Visualize and annotate LLM outputs.

## Intro
Outputs from large language models (LLMs) may contain errors: semantic, factual, and lexical. 

With **factgenie**, you can have the errors highlighted ðŸŒˆ:
- From humans through a crowdsourcing service.
- From LLMs through an API.

How does **factgenie** help with that?
1. It helps you **create a user-friendly website** for collecting annotations from human crowdworkers.
2. It helps you with **LLM API calls** for collecting equivalent annotations from LLM-based evaluators.
3. It provides you with **visualization interface** for inspecting the annotated outputs.

What does factgenie **not help with** is collecting the data or model outputs (we assume that you already have these), starting the crowdsourcing campaign (for that, you need to use a service such as [Prolific.com](https://prolific.com)) or running the LLM evaluators (for that, you need a local framework such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or a proprietary API).

## Quickstart
Make sure you have Python 3 installed (the project is tested with Python 3.10).

The following commands install the package and start the web server:
```
pip install -e .
factgenie run --host=127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```
