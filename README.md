## üì¢  News
- **10/09/2024** - We improve the UX for the annotation and the browsing interfaces. See the summary of changes [here](https://github.com/ufal/factgenie/pull/71).
- **09/08/2024** - Instructions for the annotators can be now configured directly in the web interace and in the configuration file ‚Äì no need for coding HTML!
- **31/07/2024** - We updated and expanded the README into a set of tutorials. The tutorials are available on our [Github wiki](../../wiki/).
- **31/07/2024** - We substantially improved the data management. You can now manage the datasets both through the configuration file and the web interface.
- **25/07/2024** - We published an [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17863) about factgenie. The paper is accepted to the INLG 2024 System Demonstrations track.

## üëâÔ∏è How can factgenie help you?
Outputs from large language models (LLMs) may contain errors: semantic, factual, and lexical. 

With factgenie, you can have the error spans annotated:
- From LLMs through an API.
- From humans through a crowdsourcing service.

Factgenie can provide you:
1. **A user-friendly website** for collecting annotations from human crowdworkers.
2. **API calls** for collecting equivalent annotations from LLM-based evaluators.
3. **A visualization interface** for visualizing the data and inspecting the annotated outputs.

---
*What does factgenie **not help with** is collecting the data or model outputs (we assume that you already have these), starting the crowdsourcing campaign (for that, you need to use a service such as [Prolific.com](https://prolific.com)) or running the LLM evaluators (for that, you need a local framework such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or a proprietary API).*

## üèÉ Quickstart
Make sure you have Python 3 installed (the project is tested with Python 3.10).

After cloning the repository, the following commands install the package and start the web server:
```
pip install -e .
factgenie run --host=127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

We provide multiple examples for you to get inspired when preparing your own experiments. In simple cases, you can even get without writing Python code completely!
