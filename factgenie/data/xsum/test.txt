The party's economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth warned steel's troubles were a "canary in the mine", warning of deeper problems across a range of industries.\nThese include basic metals, chemicals and wood.\nThe Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry.\nThe UK government has been asked to comment.\nPlaid said Gross Value Added (GVA) figures -  which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013.\nMr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs.\nHe said: "Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel, but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon.\n"This includes the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products. Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline."\nHe said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: "No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government.\n"We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem.\n"The economy minister has set-up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries."\nPro Steel Engineering in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is only three years old but has benefited from contracts in London, including the new Olympic Stadium roof in London for West Ham United and strengthening the Hammersmith fly-over.\nDirector Richard Selby said: "We're fortunate we're expanding and are hoping to start recruiting in a couple of months and we have a full order book.\n"We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities.\n"But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive."\nEconomist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic.\nBut he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector.\n"We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it," he said.\n"Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways.\n"A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision."\nProf Jones said the steel industry in Wales had done relatively well to avoid the worst of the crisis so far.\n"There have been big rounds of redundancies over the last 30 years and we've a very lean operation in Wales and geographically we're better placed than those steelworks in the north of England and Scotland."

The firm filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday in a bid to boost growth in one of the world's fastest growing movie markets.\nImax's China profits jumped nearly 30% last year, according to the filing.\nIt has been rapidly expanding in the Greater China region, nearly doubling the number of theatres since 2012.\nMarch figures indicate Imax has 239 theatres in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, but the company says it is planning to build another 219 theatres in China.\nNews of the listing comes as box office revenue in the world's second largest economy jumped 36% last year to $4.9bn (Â£3.2bn), which is nearly three times more than it was 2010.\nThe parent company is already listed in New York and its shares rose as much as 9% after the announcement.
Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.\n“Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?”\nThis appeared to be an impossible demand.\nSteve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.\nThen I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.
Hilary won the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Award in Harrogate on Thursday.\nRadio Times TV editor Alison Graham, who was one of the judges, described the book as "an emotionally exhausting and powerful story".\nUS author Sara Paretsky, who created detective VI Warshawski, received an outstanding contribution honour.\nThe accolades were handed out at the start of the North Yorkshire town's annual crime writing festival.\nShetland and Vera writer Ann Cleeves, this year's festival programming chair, said the crime novel of the year shortlist had been "really strong" this year.\nThe panel had felt Hilary's winning book was "so finely written and tightly written", she said.\nSomeone Else's Skin, a thriller that tackles domestic violence and so-called honour crime, is the first in a series of novels featuring Det Insp Marnie Rome.\n"The author was able to conjure up atmosphere in very few lines," Cleeves said. "The subject matter was well done and well plotted."\nThe other books on the shortlist were:\nSara Paretsky was chosen for the outstanding contribution to crime fiction award after her 23-year career writing about VI Warshawski, a female private investigator from Chicago.\nActress Kathleen Turner played VI Warshawski in a 1991 movie based on the Deadlock novel and in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation.\nVI Warshawski was "a real game changer", Cleeves said. "This was a woman who didn't just solve crimes but was like an action hero in a sense."\nParetsky "really changed the way that readers thought about female writers", Cleeves said.\n"When she started writing, it was pretty well unheard of to have a strong female protagonist," she added.\nParetsky also set up Sisters In Crime, an organisation to support female crime writers around the world.
The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.\nOnce built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.\nThe current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.\nThe total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.\nMatron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now.\n"Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being.\n"There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."\nIn the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.\nWork has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.\nDr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients.\n"This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."\nSomerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.\nThe aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014.

Jamie Vardy's crisp finish from a lightning break gave Leicester the lead on 18 minutes - but he was then sent off after getting a second yellow card for diving when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna early in the second half.\nReferee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left. There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner.\nAnalysis: MOTD2 pundits on referee's 'mind-boggling inconsistencies'\nSubstitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester's run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left-footed finish two minutes later.\nAs the game went into injury time, Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp.\nWest Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour, but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend's home game with Swansea.\nRelive the action from the King Power Stadium\nLeicester's fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end.\nPsychologically, this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday.\nIt means Leicester's last Premier League defeat is still that last-minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine's Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty-handed.\nReferee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle.\nMoss's eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna. Having already given Vardy a yellow card, he felt obliged to give a second.\nVardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment. And he has been accused of doing this before this season. Opinion was split but plenty felt Moss was right.\nFor West Ham's penalty, there was undoubtedly pulling and pushing between Morgan and Winston Reid - so again Moss had justification.\nThe difficulty, the inconsistency, is that similar behaviour had been going on in both penalty areas all afternoon without punishment - so why did Moss decide this was the time to penalise it?\nToo often, these decisions seem arbitrary, as was demonstrated when Ogbonna dragged Huth to the floor even more unceremoniously a few minutes later and no foul was given.\nFinally, in injury time and with an atmosphere of chaos engulfing the game, Moss pointed to the spot for the slightest touch from Carroll on Schlupp. It was incredibly harsh and the Hammers clearly felt Moss had punished them to make up for earlier decisions given against Leicester.\nIt is a tough job - as the abuse directed the referee's way at the end proved.\nNot as much as there might have been had Ulloa not scored at the end, but they can apply pressure and move to within five points of Leicester if they win at Stoke.\nLeicester at least have the point in the bag but Mauricio Pochettino and his players will just feel the door is ajar, even if they know time and games are running out.\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri: "It was a very tough match. We were lucky at the beginning when they touched both posts. After that we scored a great goal and we had an opportunity to finish the match at the beginning of the second half.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n"After then sending off it changed our match.\n"I never spoke about the decision of the referee. Two yellow cards, that's it.\n"Our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic."\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "It was a good game of football. We showed determination, character and quality. We turned the game around. We were dangerous, and after sending off we totally dominated the game.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n"After our second goal I thought we had done enough to win the game, maybe we could have coped with added time better in terms of keeping the ball but they took the risk.\n"It was extremely hard for referee, but I mean that was no penalty at all."\nLeicester - minus the suspended Vardy - are at home to Swansea next Sunday.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.\nIt is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.\nIt lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.\nAPC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.\nThe PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.\nThe party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.\nIt also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.\nHowever, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.\nThe PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.\nTaraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.\nElections were not held in seven states.\nAnalysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja\nThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.
The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the "full English" of cancers.\nGill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not "feel cheated" and had been "very lucky" in his life.\nSunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been "a giant among journalists" and the "heart and soul" of the paper he joined in 1993.\nThe final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times.\nIn a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: "It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning.\n"Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."\nHe added: "He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion.\n"Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."\nWriting about his illness in November, Gill had said he had "an embarrassment of cancer, the full English.\n"There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."\nWriters, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia.\nJay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a "controversialist" but also "a kind man and a brilliant writer".\nSunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as "the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times".\n"The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office," he added.\nTimes Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been "the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style".\nJohn Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique.\n"In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."\nAnother former editor, Andrew Neil, added: "Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had "trashed" him for 20 years, but always did so "with magnificently eloquent savagery" as well as "an irritating kernel of truth".\nWhile his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy.\nIn October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups.\nIn 1998, he described the Welsh as "dark, ugly little trolls" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as "a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile".\nIn a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the "hernia on the end of England", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it "smelled of boiled washing".\nIn 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a "dyke on a bike".\nHe was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins.\nBorn in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer.\nHe went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London.\nHe began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times.\nHis first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991.\nThey had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced.\nGill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac.\nHe said he had been "surprisingly excited" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as "The Blonde" in his restaurant reviews.
Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would "very much like" to run but a "handful of people at the top" had ensured she could not.\nMs Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand.\nShe said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.\nMs Evans said UKIP needed to "break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground" and also conduct some "internal reform".\nThe leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his "political ambition has been achieved".\nIn a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: "I'd very much like to run in that election.\n"Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't."\nShe claimed the party rulebook had been "abused" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest.\nHer six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority.\nMs Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision.\nIn the statement, she said: "I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP."\nMs Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that "allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this", but she said the support from members had made her "more determined ever not to give up on UKIP".\nShe also said that with the right leader, the "sky was the limit for the party".\nEndorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was "the best chance" UKIP had to "change, to grow and to thrive".\nShe said UKIP needed "a clean break from the past" to become more like a political party than "just a rugby club on tour".\nUnder Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be "more united and consensual".\nPrior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's "unresignation" after the general election.\nMr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him.
France's Dubuisson carded a 67 to tie with overnight leader Van Zyl of South Africa on 16 under par.\nMcIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67 to move to 15 under par with Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat.\nThe world number three's round included an eagle on the 12th as he bids to win his first title since May.\n"The 67s I've shot this week have all been a little different and I feel like I've played within myself for all of them, " said four-time major winner McIlroy of Northern Ireland. "I feel there's a low round out there for me and hopefully it's tomorrow."\nMcIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag.\nBut he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet.\nThe former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments.\nBut he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whistling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Frys.com Open in California.\nHe is targeting a third Race to Dubai title in four years and leads England's Danny Willett by 271, 214 points with three events remaining after the Turkish Open.\nEnglish pair Chris Wood (-13) and Richard Bland (-12) who were tied for second overnight are fifth and seventh respectively.
Avon and Somerset Police closed the Lower Bristol Road in Bath at Rackfield Place outside the First depot after the crash at 03:00 GMT.\nThe A36 road closure, which was lifted at 14:00 GMT, had caused disruption and delays to commuters and bus services during rush hour.\nInvestigations are under way into how the collision happened.\nLocal Live has all the latest travel news\nFirst said that while parts of its services had resumed a normal schedule, it would take a few hours for all services to return to normal.\nManaging director James Freeman said: "We are hoping we will have a full service running in time for the evening commute.\n"We would like to thank the public for their support and understanding and staff for going beyond their call of duty to help manage the situation and recovery."
Health Inspectorate Wales said Wrexham Maelor Hospital staff were under "considerable pressure" for long periods as ambulances waited outside.\nIt said inspectors were told the situation was not unusual.\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was working to manage the pressures.\nInspectors visited the A&E unit and another ward on 30 September and 1 October last year and have released reports about what they found.\nDespite the pressures in A&E they said staff were observed to be effectively prioritising clinical need and patient care.\nOn the Mason Ward, inspectors found patients to be well looked after and said staff were committed to providing good standards of care.\nAngela Hopkins, executive director of nursing and midwifery at the health board, said its hospitals were experiencing growing demand like the rest of the UK.\n"We are focussing on the improvement of emergency department and ward processes for both admission and discharge to reduce delays," she said.\n"We are increasing the numbers of nursing staff and extra beds have been opened.\n"We are also working in partnership with local authorities and the Welsh Ambulance Service to ensure that the system works more smoothly to improve patient flow through the hospital."
Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out.\nCycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m.\nBadminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was "staggered" by the "incomprehensible" decision to remove the sport's funding.\nA total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games.\nAs a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo.\nBritain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147.\nChair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has "confirmed its commitment" for Tokyo 2020.\nHe added: "These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained."\nBadminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed.\nMarcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle.\nChristy said the decision represents a "catastrophic impact on the sport" and Badminton England would "fight for the hopes and dreams" of its players.\n"How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?" he said.\n"What have we done wrong?" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin.\nJudo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly.\nLiz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly.\n"We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential," she said.\n"If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk."\nSports minister Tracey Crouch added: "UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020."\nBasketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build "performance pathways for future success" was supposed to be aimed at such sports.\nA British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: "It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review.\n"With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport."\nUK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed.\nBaseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme.\nUK Sport says funding will be determined "following further exploration of medal potential", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated.\nLiam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: "The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open.\n"We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders."
Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died last week at his home in Swansea, the city at the centre of an epidemic of the disease which has reached 942 cases.\nBut the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death.\nAn inquest will be opened and adjourned on Tuesday to allow further tests.\nSince the outbreak began in November, 83 people have needed hospital treatment for the illness.\nMr Colfer-Williams' mother, Angela Colfer said her son had recently been treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for asthma.\nA few days after he was discharged he became unwell and developed a rash.\nMrs Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash "from head to foot" but not on his arms.\nThe following morning, Mr Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat.\nPublic Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death.\nThe family said they had no idea how Mr Colfer-Williams got measles as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.

The 39-year-old, from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, revealed the news live on BBC One's The One Show on Thursday evening but has yet to reveal the name.\nIt is Miss Jones' first child with partner Charlie Thomson and he was born in the morning of Sunday, 22 January, weighing 7lbs 11.\nMs Jones was concerned she had left it too late to have a baby after filming a documentary, Fertility and Me.
Kim Clark, from Kinross, died after being hit the car outside an address in South Street, Milnathort, on Tuesday.\nPolice said Mrs Clark's family were understandably upset at their loss and that she would be greatly missed.\nOfficers said inquiries into the circumstances of the incident were ongoing.
He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said.\nIt added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date.\nHogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement.\nThe conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years.\nThe AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments.\nAmong his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.\nHogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt.\nHis first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London.\nHe was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US.\n"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit," Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said.\n"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director."\nThe AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: "I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him."\nSpeaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: "Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him.\n"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person."\nDavid Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London added: "He always said I want the music to speak for itself because it can, it's good enough, it willâ€¦ a very pleasant and lovely man."
The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman was not in the House of Commons to hear Prime Minister David Cameron make his argument for air strikes.\nThe Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Lib Dems were all critical.\nThe SNP defended MP and MSP Mr Salmond saying he was on constituency business.\nA spokesman stated that Mr Salmond attended a "full briefing" on Wednesday from the security services and the joint chiefs about the Syria situation and there was "nothing in the PM's statement which was of surprise or new".\nHe added that SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, had responded as planned to Mr Cameron's address.\nAnd when the issue is fully debated in the Commons, Mr Salmond would make his contribution as his party's foreign affairs spokesman.\nAfter attending First Minister's Questions at Holyrood, the former SNP leader visited the Scottish National Portrait Gallery where he unveiled the painting, by artist Gerard M Burns.\nLater Mr Salmond is due to host a Scottish Parliamentary reception for veterans, serving armed forces personnel, and local community representatives.\nHe will also brief MSPs on the SNP position on Syria.\nHowever, the long-arranged portrait unveiling was criticised by Ms Davidson who said: "There is nothing more serious than the potential deployment of our service personnel abroad.\n"Alex Salmond has form in unveiling vanity projects to himself but he needs to remember he's paid - twice over - to be a parliamentarian, not an art critic."\nMr Rennie added: "Nothing gets in the way of Alex Salmond's ego including debating war and peace in our country and the Middle East.\n"His absence from the Commons at this critical moment means we will be more sceptical about his motivations the next time he expresses outrage on the matter."\nA spokesman for Scottish Labour said: "If Alex Salmond was chocolate he would eat himself. On the day that he had a job to do in parliament over Syria it's ridiculous that the SNP's foreign affairs spokesperson was in Edinburgh to look at a picture of himself."
The president-elect has said Mrs Trump and Barron will move to Washington "very soon, after he's finished with school", but has not put an actual date on the move.\nBut transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were "energised and excited about their new role serving the country" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media.\n"First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world," wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. "Melania Trump's decision is appalling."\nOthers joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage.\nHowever, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence.\nBut Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters.\n"Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age," one Twitter user noted.\nHowever, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers.\nBut they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before?\nWilliam Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season.\nThe president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as "Oak View" but it was more commonly known as "Red Top" because of its red roof.\nBut the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House.\n"The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not," Mr Seale said.\n"It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising."\nMr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House.\nJames Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school.\nThere have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively.\nThey also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration.\nIn fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009.\nRead more: Why Obama may not go quietly\nMrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have.\nOfficially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses.\nIn more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school.\nThe first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale.\n"It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president," he said. "[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part."\nLou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said.\nHer immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration.\nOne notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale.\nMrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife.\n"Her big interest in the world was her husband," Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person.\nAs to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying.\nRead more: Taking to the streets for women's issues\nIt has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive.\nThomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier.\nHowever, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's "proxy wife" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother?\nThere is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career.\nThe White House can be whatever the family makes it.\nChelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter.\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected.\nThe Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family.\n"The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been," the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year.\nIt is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years.\nShe told the Huffington Post: "I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal."
Gatland won a first clean sweep in his maiden Six Nations as coach in 2008 after Wales' disappointing 2007 World Cup display.\nHe guided Wales to a second Grand Slam in 2012 after narrowly missing out on the 2011 World Cup final.\n"We were disappointed not getting to the final in 2011," he said.\n"We feel a little bit the same this time around.\n"There's a little bit of frustration as we felt we could have gone a bit further in the World Cup, although we were proud of what we achieved given the number of injuries we had."\nWales qualified alongside Australia from their World Cup pool despite a host of injuries to key players such as Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies and Rhys Webb.\nWales were knocked out of the World Cup by two-time champions South Africa in the quarter-final despite leading with 10 minutes remaining.\nWebb and Halfpenny are still out injured, but centre Davies has returned while backs Liam Williams and Hallam Amos are returning to fitness.\nWales hold the record of Championship victories - 26 outright and 12 shared - and a third Grand Slam in nine years would mean they join England on a record 12 Grand Slams.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIreland are bidding to become the first side ever to win the Championship three times in a row and Wales coach Gatland said: "You can't look past the Irish."\nThe New Zealander also said that England under new coach Eddie Jones are an "unknown quantity" in "a really open competition".\nWales begin their Six Nations bid against the defending champions in Dublin - the same venue where the Welsh began their 2012 Grand Slam campaign.\n"We're in pretty good shape," added Gatland, himself a former Ireland coach.\n"There's a few new coaches this year and the familiarly will help us put things together quickly.\n"Our time together at the World Cup is invaluable preparation and potentially a slight advantage.\n"It is massive that we're going away to Dublin first and if we can win that first game, the next game at home against Scotland is six days later.\n"Momentum is huge in this competition."
Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.\nIt says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.\nThe Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards".\nThe Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.\nThe study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.\nThe report cites figures that suggest  apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.\nOnly 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.\nThe report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.\nThe report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.\nAnd it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.\nIn his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor".\nThe attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said.\n"Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said.\nHe said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.\nThe report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.\nNo more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.\nSir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\n"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\n"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs."\nTeresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\n"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\n"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved."\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\n"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.\n"We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month."
David Mackintosh, Conservative MP for Northampton South, announced his decision ahead of a local party meeting where his candidacy was expected to be opposed.\nThe BBC reported millions of pounds of public money loaned to Northampton Town FC appeared to have vanished.\nThe MP has denied any wrongdoing.\nMr Mackintosh was criticised over the loan to Northampton Town Football Club from the borough council - when he was leader - to rebuild Sixfields stadium and develop nearby land.\nAbout £10.25m of that money is now missing and the loan is subject to a police investigation into "alleged financial irregularities".\nThe football stand remains half built.\nWhen contacted by the BBC last week, a majority of his party's local executive council said they would vote to deselect him.\nMr Mackintosh had previously said he intended to stand for re-election.\nBut in a statement, he said: "It has been a huge honour to be the member of Parliament since 2015, but I now feel it is the right time for my constituents to have a new representative."
The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n"Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb," he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the "revolution" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a "truly global company" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK," said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.\n"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries."\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment," he told BBC News.\n"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit."\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines.

Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty appeared to have Saints in control, with Hull offering little in the way of an attacking threat.\nThe hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first-half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans, but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second-half minutes.\nFirst, Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free-kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster.\nSouthampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time.\nThe win - Hull's first in the league since 20 August - ends a six-game losing streak, although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe best that could be said for the early loss of Hull's strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury.\nBut his entrance from the bench following Keane's injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers' top scorer - far from it.\nInstantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29-year-old on the pitch, having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction.\nThe mood inside the stadium at kick-off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years.\nThat run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family's running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick-off, with an official attendance of just 17,768.\nEmpty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers, and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance cannot have been lost on the players.\nYet Snodgrass' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team-mates, and his well-taken 61st-minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour.\nSouthampton celebrated one of the most famous wins in their history by beating Inter Milan in the Europa League on Thursday, and a Hull side low on confidence did not look like dampening their mood in the opening exchanges.\nAustin's early penalty - an easy decision for referee Graham Scott after Curtis Davies' clumsy challenge on Maya Yoshida - had the visitors in cruise control, with Hull allowing them time and space to pass the ball around, albeit with little cutting edge.\nVirgil van Dijk's looping header off the bar early in the second half was as close as they came to doubling their lead, and that apparent lack of urgency came back to bite them when Hull struck their quick-fire double just after the hour mark.\nThat was the spark for Claude Puel's men to push forward with greater urgency, but in former Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall they found someone in determined mood after a miserable start to life between the sticks in East Yorkshire.\nThe Scotland international - whose elevation to number one ahead of Eldin Jakupovic coincided with Hull's slump in form - twice saved well from Austin as time ticked down, and also kept out a Yoshida effort.\nDawson then came to the rescue to heroically block from Austin, before Clucas produced a stunning goalline clearance deep in added time, the winger hacking the ball off the line, against Jay Rodriguez and somehow over the bar.\nHull City boss Mike Phelan, speaking to Match of the Day: "I'm really pleased for my players. We lost two players early in the game to what look like long injuries. The players are ecstatic. I thought we caused our own problems in the first half giving the penalty away and not getting the ball quick enough.\n"The players were a credit. Our keeper David Marshall has had a hard time of late but he was magnificent. Robert Snodgrass had the most unbelievable swollen ankle at one point which disappeared overnight. He showed great character.\n"Now that we have got three or four injuries, the international break has come at a good time for us. We will enjoy the next few days and start again."\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSouthampton manager Claude Puel, speaking to Match of the Day: "We lacked concentration. We lost the rhythm of the game. It is important for the future that we learn from this situation.\n"After a European game it is difficult to keep the same concentration. It is a good lesson for the future.\n"We know all the teams are difficult to play and to play every three days is difficult. We have to learn this and keep the same concentration every game."\nFollowing the international break, Hull return to action with a trip to bottom side Sunderland on Saturday, 19 November (15:00 GMT), while on the same day Southampton play host to leaders Liverpool, also at 15:00.\nMatch ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nSecond Half ends, Hull City 2, Southampton 1.\nDelay over.

Police in Arkansas wish to unlock an iPhone and iPod belonging to two teenagers accused of killing a couple, according to the Associated Press (AP).\nLess than a day after its San Bernardino announcement, the FBI agreed to help in the homicide case.\nSyed Farook and his wife were shot dead after killing 14 people in December.\nA judge agreed to postpone the Arkansas case on 28 March to allow prosecutors to ask the FBI for help.\nHunter Drexler, 18, and Justin Staton, 15, are accused of killing Robert and Patricia Cogdell at their home in Conway, Arkansas last July.\nStaton had been raised as a grandson by the Cogdells.\n"We always appreciate [the FBI's] cooperation and willingness to help their local law enforcement partners," Faulkner County prosecuting attorney Cody Hilland told the AP.\nAn attorney for Mr Drexler told the AP he was "not concerned" about any data on the phone.\nPreviously, the FBI had asked Apple to write new software that would allow it to gain access to Farook's iPhone.\nHowever, the company refused, arguing it would be wrong to compromise the security of one of its devices since that might lead to vulnerabilities in many other iPhones.
The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group.\nMighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices.\nBoth companies reject the allegations.\nSingapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia.\nIndonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo.\nSingapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market.\nMighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires.\nIt also says Olam created a "secretive market for rogue palm oil companies" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources.\nBut Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a "very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy".\nThe company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so.\nMr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete.\nHe added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain.\nSince Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven.\nTemasek's investment in Olam means that "the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze," the report says.\nTemasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they "fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same."\nThe fund told the BBC: "Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address.\n"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam."\nIt would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record.\nIt is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations.\nGreen groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible.\nActivists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas.\nThe report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam "bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations," bringing the same practices to Africa "that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia".\nIn response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent.\n"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done," it said.\n"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain."
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran.\nHer husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in "secret".\nIt is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella.\nThe child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed.\nMr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was "another of these secret trials".\nHe said: "Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."\nMr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.\nHe said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome "might come today, it might come next week".\nThere was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.\nMr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was "more fight in her" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.\nHe told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was "unpredictable" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.\nSpeaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: "I have watched her grow up on Skype.\n"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English.\n"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."\nMr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.\nAmnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a "prisoner of conscience" who was being held for "peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association".\nRisk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: "Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release."

I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out."\nElsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go.\nAnd in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride.\nOlympic gold medallist Chris Boardman\n"Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there.\n"We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.\n"But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there.\n"More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that."\nSix-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy\n"I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in.\n"But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race.\n"He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team."\nTeam pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson.\nThe young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress.\nShe told the BBC: "It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting.\n"The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in.\n"Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds."\nDouble Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: "Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal.\n"Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them."\nEarlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round.\nThe 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong.\nThe former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday.\nMarchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin.\n"I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected," she said.\n"I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great.\n"I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo."\nMedia playback is not supported on this device

Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version.\nYouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content.\nMany young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google.\nThey say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government.\nA Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube.\nThe Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: "Welcome Back YouTube".\nPakistan's ministry of information technology said: "Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly.\n"Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan."\nHowever, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted.\n"We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them," she said.\n"In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review."\nShe said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report.\nPakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.\nThe amateur-made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\nMore than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan.\nBlasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty, although such a sentence has not been carried out.\nGoogle revealed last week that it had launched local versions of YouTube for Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday.\nFor decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers.\nEx-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a "very, very important place" through which most of the public received its information.\nThe first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702.\nAt its height, "the Street of Shame" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius.\nMr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years.\nHe is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats.\nAlthough the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides.\n"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\n"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."\nThe street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women.\nHe says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\n"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."\nMr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\n"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."\nHis memories of the street in its heyday are of "watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers".\n"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."\nMr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of "certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then".\nFollowing their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs.\nRobin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\n"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers," he says.\n"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."\nLiz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\n"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\n"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\n"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\n"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\n"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\n"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\n"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him.\n"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"\nBut, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble.\nMedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions.\nBy 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.\nAs a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the "Stab in the Back" is a Pizza Express.\nNow a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.\n"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me," says Mr Smith.\n"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history."
He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday.\nShe had been a "guiding example" of what a good monarch should be, he said.\nMeanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released.\nThe Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday.\nText and video coverage of the day's events\n'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor\nIn pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images\nBBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch\nFull coverage: Queen at 90\nHer visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir.\nThe royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday.\nPrime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions.\nMr Cameron said Thursday was an "important landmark", adding the monarch had served the nation with "dignity".\nIn an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: "The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."\nThe prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as "work-shy William".\nHe said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart.\n"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role," he said.\nHe said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.\n'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview\nBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell\nThe recent headlines about William being a "work shy" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.\nIn the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.\nHe accepts that he will be criticised "but it's not something I take completely to heart".\nAn indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.\nIt was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.\nThere was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.\nWhen asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was "the best role model I could have in front of me".\nFull details of Queen's birthday celebrations\nTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.\nThe picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.\nSix further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.\nOn her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.\nIt was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.\nIn the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.\nOn Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.\nBritain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.\nRepublic said the Queen's birthday "does not warrant this kind of coverage" and that the BBC had a "duty to report, not to celebrate the royals".\nGraham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had "failed completely" to report the birthday in a way that was "fair, balanced and proportionate".
Pulido, who plays for the Greek club, Olympiakos, cut his wrist when he punched a glass pane on a door as he tried to escape before police arrived.\nPulido, 25, was abducted at gunpoint on Saturday night in his home town of Ciudad Victoria in Tamaulipas state.\nA 38-year-old man has been arrested.\nOfficials say the man had confessed to belonging to a local criminal gang. Police are searching for another three men believed to have been involved in the kidnapping.\nState prosecutor Ismael Quintanilla said the masked gang had taken Pulido to a house in Ciudad Victoria where he eventually found himself alone with one of his abductors.\n"They traded blows. He takes it [the phone] and calls [emergency number] 066. It all happened very quickly," Mr Quintanilla told Imagen radio.\nAn official report of the calls Pulido made to the emergency operator, obtained by the Associated Press, revealed that he threatened and beat the kidnapper while on the phone, demanding to be told where they were.\nIn one of the calls, Pulido said police were outside and starting to shoot so he described what he was wearing to avoid being mistaken for a kidnapper.\nPulido had been abducted when his car was surrounded by several vehicles as he was leaving a party with his girlfriend on Saturday night.\nMasked men whisked him away, leaving his girlfriend unharmed.\nPulido's family received a phone call on Sunday demanding a ransom payment, Mr Quintanilla told reporters. No ransom was paid.\nPulido, with one of his hands bandaged, told reporters early on Monday: "[I am] very well, thank God."\nTamaulipas is one of Mexico's most violent states, and Mexico recently deployed more security forces to tackle cartels operating in the area.\nThe country has one of the world's highest kidnapping rates, with government figures saying some 1,000 people are abducted every year.\nPulido joined Olympiakos last July and finished the season with six goals in 15 games.\nHe was part of Mexico's squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but was not called up for the upcoming Copa America tournament.
Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.\nHalf of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.\nThe survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.\nAubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.\nOf the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.\n(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)\nEngland's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.\nTrust chairman, Rob Rees, said: "Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.\n"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."\nMumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: "Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.\n"From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.\n"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety."\nSchool meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.\nAbout four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.\nMore children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.\nThe survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.
Fellow tenants Newport Gwent Dragons are subject to a takeover bid from the Welsh Rugby Union, who have said they see Rodney Parade "as a rugby venue."\nCounty have a lease to use the ground - and have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League - until 2023.\n"Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract," Foxall said.\n"That is something that we're expecting to be honoured.\n"Obviously there is a vote in early May by the shareholders for Newport Rugby and we'll wait and see what happens with that."\nThe WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.\nIn 2013 the Exiles agreed a 10-year lease to use the stadium after gaining promotion to the Football League from the Conference.\nNewport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said both County and Newport Squash Club, who are also based at Rodney Parade, are protected under their current agreements.\nGodfrey said the WRU had been made aware of that fact. The WRU have signalled their intention to install an artificial surface which is against Football League rules.\nOn the pitch, County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining after six wins in 10 games under caretaker manager Mike Flynn and can clinch survival this weekend if they win and rivals Hartlepool lose.\nNewport secured promotion back to the Football League in 2013 and Foxall said relegation to the National League would be a "massive" blow,\n"To lose that status again, in a relatively short space of time would be pretty devastating for the fans but also for the city of Newport," Foxall told BBC Wales Today.
Although there is some common ground between the two governments on, for example, the need for free trade within the single market, Carwyn Jones has complained that he didn't see the letter before it was published on Wednesday. (He has that in common with most of Mrs May's cabinet).\nThe first minister told AMs: "I discussed the Article 50 letter in general terms with the prime minister when we met in Swansea last week.\n"I should be clear, though, that I didn't see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting. This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect.\n"It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK."\nMr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: "I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks.\n"We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months.\n"We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned."\nMrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter. She told Donald Tusk: "When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n"But it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration."\nThat sentence may have been written more with Scotland in mind, but it does prompt the question: which powers? Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers?\nAlun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020. (Perhaps Mr Jones doesn't think Jeremy Corbyn will win power that year - Labour has pledged to maintain EU funding levels on regional aid beyond 2020).\nSome in Whitehall think the way EU money has been spent in Wales - check out Nick Clegg's film from Ebbw Vale - is an argument for transferring those powers to Westminster, but that looks politically less likely now.\nWe may get some more details about the process in a white paper on the Great Repeal Bill on Thursday but, at the moment, the identity of the powers the UK government wants to see devolved is something of a mystery.
However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation.\nIn 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.\nA further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.\nThese events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.\nRancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.\nIn September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.\nIn 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.\nFiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.\nThe two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.\nMixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.\nThere are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.\nAlthough the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.\nNonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.
The Labour leader has also said he is "very angry" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire.\nPM Theresa May said the residents were "in our thoughts and prayers" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire.\nBut she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday.\nAt least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday.\nMr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was "very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did," said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them "peace of mind".\nAnd he told MPs on Thursday: "The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country.\n"The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country.\n"And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally.\n"It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."\nMrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the attack. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.\nMr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: "People are angry and I share that anger."\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nBut Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: "Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV."\nThe prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the "professionalism and bravery" of the emergency services.\nShe pledged that the government "stands ready to provide every assistance" to the council and emergency services.\n"I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home."\nShe has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: "What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy."\nHe said the "exceptionally complex" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for "plodding bureaucracy" in the official response.\n"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned," he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried."\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised "every single family" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, "to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had "publicly committed" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had "not been started".\n"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building," he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was "simply not true" that a report about building regulations had been "sat on".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.
Morata, 23, who is playing for Spain at Euro 2016, joined Juventus in 2014, after four seasons with Real.\nThe terms of his move to Italy included an option for Real to buy him back, with the fee reported to be up to 30m euros (£23m).\nMorata, previously reported to be a target for Arsenal and Chelsea, has scored three times for Spain in France.\nHe scored 27 goals in two years for Juventus, winning two Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias.\nMorata played in back-to-back Champions League finals, having appeared as a substitute in Real's 2014 win and scoring in Juventus' 3-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2015.\nThe 6ft 3in striker came through the ranks at Real, making his first team debut at 18, and scored 10 goals for the La Liga side.\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

Vettel responded: "You didn't. You were lucky this time." Kvyat shrugged: "I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."\nIn the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: "You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."\nListen to Vettel's post-race rant\nAt the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.\nIn the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.\nRicciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.\nMercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.\nListen to the first-lap madness\nHamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.\nSo Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.\nHe began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.\n"The car was pretty damaged," said the 31-year-old afterwards. "I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."\nMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a "lot of aerodynamic performance".\nAfter a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.\nChinese Grand Prix race results\nChinese Grand Prix coverage details
It works by looking for a combination of "markers" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease.\nDelegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.\nIt could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said.\nThe test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE.\nBut through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease.\nMost notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test.\nProf Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients.\nBut he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.\n"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.\n"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future."\nHe said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.\nIt could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained.\nPotentially, it could be a "cheap and easy pre-screen" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.\n"The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.\n"If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing."\nDr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital.\n"While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising.\n"When used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help."
The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history.\nAlmost all of the pro-European "big beasts" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics.\nAccording to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether.\nThe estimate of more than a hundred outright "withdrawalists" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe.\nOnly ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the "Better Off Out" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal.\nToday Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water.\nThat impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity.\nOne of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now "mainstream" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as "the love that dare not speak its name".\nThe other complained of a "supine approach" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government.\nWhen the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a "cast-iron guarantee" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as "no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum".\nThe Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise.\n"The collateral damage from that broken promise", our un-nameable MP said, "is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now".\nCould the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg?\nThere are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too.\nLast year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour.\nMr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop "the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries".\nThat theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband.\nMaurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies.\nHe told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause.\nAll these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again.\nAnd the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe.\nDouglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership:\n"Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc", he says, "we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join."\nBut Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.\nTory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.\nThere is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\n"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis", says Tim Montgomerie, "every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity."\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST\nDownload the Analysis podcast\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nFollow Analysis on Facebook\nLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.\nThe meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for "new thinking" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.\nOne of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described "this in-or-out discussion" as "a bit crude", and said she thinks the choice is between "the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship".\nThe wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.\nAlmost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.\nThat in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply "wave goodbye" altogether.\nAnd Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.\nIt is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.\nThose MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.\nIt is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.\nBack then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.\nThey are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.\nIf they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.\nBut not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.\nPart of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.\nWhere he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.\nBetween them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.\nWith Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\nBut he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.\nLooking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.\nIt is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.\nThat means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.\nDoing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.\nIn their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.\nThey look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.\nWhen I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.\nAgain, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.\nAnother problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.\nMore than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.\nSadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.\nLiverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\nFrom Mamadou Sakho for £18m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for £20m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.\nThey still look all over the place at the back.\nStatistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.\nLiverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\nWhat Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\nSimon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.\nRodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.\nHe was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.\nLiverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\nNow he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.\nMy team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.\nFor me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.\nIt is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.\nIt is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet\nHe was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.\nAlthough he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.\nTo compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.\nWhether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.\nThat way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.\nGoing forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.\nThe trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.\nHe will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.\nEven if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.\nJose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.\nThe only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.\nThe Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.\nThere is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.\nWhatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\nHe was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.\nPlaying in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.\nThe older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.\nAt 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.\nWhat he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.\nBecause, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that "his legs have gone".\nOf course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.\nWhat happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside\nBut it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.\nAs you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.\nThere is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.\nI knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.\nWhat does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.\nI knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.\nFor me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players.\nOf all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with.\nHe was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen.\nSaturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.\nOf course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him.\nIt would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does.\nIt is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.\nRobbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan
Glamorgan's total was dominated by Nick Selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century.\nBut seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital.\nGloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day.\nSelman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea.\nAneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon.\nGraham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point.\nGloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced.\nGlamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem.\nGlamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport:\n"It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred.\n"(My season) was going well up until after (a century in) Swansea, after Swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants.\n"Opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the UK), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit.\n"I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season."\nGloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol:\n"There's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220.\n"I was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today.\n"I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now I'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great.\n"It's definitely going to be tough (for the Gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score."
Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.\nThe firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.\nRecovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.\nGreater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.\nGeoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."\nThe fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.\n"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.\nAn EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.\n"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."\nThe cause of the fire remains undetermined.

Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar was performing in the country's capital Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place.\nRussian news reports said he was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face.\nThe Russian embassy said it was investigating, but called local press reports "distorted".\nThe rapper had taken to the stage in a red deel - a Mongolian robe - embroidered with a swastika.\nThough associated with the Nazis, the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler.\nMr Sukhbaatar's father, Sevjidiin Sukhbaatar, told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating.\n"My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured. His brain was seriously hurt," he said.\nMr Sukhbaatar displayed a book of traditional swastika patterns to emphasise that it is not a hate symbol in his country.\nThe Russian official accused of attacking the rapper has not been identified.\nIn a statement, the Russian embassy said it was investigating press and social media reports of the assault.\n"According to our preliminary information," it said, the reports were "distorted, particularly about the date, the number of participants and the circumstances of the accident".\nTens of millions of Soviet citizens died fighting the forces of Nazi Germany during World War Two.\nThe swastika is believed to have originated in India thousands of years ago, and was used in Mongolia as a symbol of eternity centuries before the Third Reich.\nAmarmandakh Sukhbaatar - who is known as Amraa and is the lead singer of the band Khar Sarnai [Black Rose] - frequently wears the symbol on stage, and his songs often refer to his country's history, culture and identity.\nThe swastika is also used by groups on Mongolia's far-right however.\nThe musician's lawyer, father, and a band member denied reports on social media that he shouted "Heil Hitler" at the show.\nLawyer Gankhuugiin Batbayar said the suspect in the beating had not been arrested, adding: "[He] must be investigated according to Mongolian law, no matter his status or immunity as a diplomat".\nA police spokesman told the AFP news agency that the case was under investigation.\n"The suspect is a Russian diplomatic officer and the reason he wasn't kept in detention is the injury is not serious," he said.\n"It's not true that the suspect wasn't arrested because of diplomatic immunity."

The Dons boss has guided his team to successive second-place finishes in the Scottish Premiership, and lifted the 2014 League Cup.\nGoing into Sunday's game against Rangers, Aberdeen are 12 points clear of the Ibrox side in second place.\n"Derek's doing everything he can, extracting every ounce out of the club," Thompson told BBC Scotland.\n"I thought last summer, could they achieve more than they had done, was it maybe the right time for Derek to go, what else could he do with this Aberdeen team?\n"He's come up trumps again. If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n"Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose."\nThe Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.\nThey may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.\n"Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side," Thompson added. "Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.\n"The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done."\nMeanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.\nThe Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n"For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team," Thompson said. "It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.\n"I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.\n"Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.\n"If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me."\nThompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.\nThe 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.\n"It's far too early to be making judgements," Thompson asserted. "None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.\n"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.\n"Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism."

Landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).\nBut many are put off - because a licence can cost ??1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ??20,000, Southampton City Council said.\nThe authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area.\nShelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants.\n"Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.\nNationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.\nIn Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).\nA council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."\nThe council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.
As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile.\nHe was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex.\nThere he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football.\n"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet," he said.\n"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper.\n"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence."\nHe says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.\nWhilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.\n"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march."\nE715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.\nWhilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.\n"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz," he said.\n"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.\n"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next."\nBut when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.\n"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches," he said.\n"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.\n"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.\n"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.\n"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up."\nMr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.\n"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us," he said.\n"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.\n"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'."\n"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.\n"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves."\nAs the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.\nThe Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.\nBut by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.\n"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria."\n"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone."\nMr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.\n"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all," he said.\n"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late."

The charge follows the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.\nCity had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.\nCity manager Pep Guardiola apologised for his team's part in the incident.\nAguero, 28, received a four-match ban for what was his second dismissal for violent conduct this season, following a high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz.\nFernandinho clashed with Fabregas in the scuffle that followed Aguero's challenge, and the Brazil midfielder will serve a three-match ban.\nBoth clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge.
He was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006.\nSince carrying the torch on 26 June, Doncaster-based L/Bdr Parkinson has had thousands of requests on Facebook.\nBut the site limits friend associations to 5,000 per personal page and he cannot accept all the requests.\nFlanked by hundreds of people, he walked for nearly half an hour with the Olympic torch with an assistant who supported his arm.\nL/Bdr Parkinson's nomination stated: "The brain injury took his speech, but not his personality and sense of humour," adding he now speaks unaided.\nIt said: "Determined to prove everyone wrong, he fought back every step of the way. Ben's intelligence and wit [are] unchanged. Still the same funny and caring Ben."\nHe spends 12 hours a day in the gym and rehab and walks with crutches, spending "the rest of his time spent raising money for many military charities and as patron of his beloved  \n          Pilgrim Bandits\n".\nL/Bdr Parkinson's mother Diane said the responses had "been phenomenal" and that Ben was really "buoyed up" by the support and friendship he had been shown.\nShe said: "It's just unbelievable, Ben's had way over 5,000 friend requests but Facebook won't let him have more than that number.\n"Thousands of people have joined the Pilgrim Bandits website and the messages of support we've had are great.\n"Ben's page has had 19,000 hits just on an update, I don't understand how these things work, but it's phenomenal."\nShe said the amount of post the family had received had also increased.\nShe added: "Some mail has just been addressed to Ben, please Mr Postie.\n"E-mail traffic has gone through the roof and Ben's had hundreds of requests to visit places with the [Olympic] torch.\n"He's absolutely bouncing and buoyed up and elated."\nFacebook would not comment on the issue but their guidance was that if people were receiving this many requests then they have become a public figure, so should consider having a page instead of a profile.\nAlternatively, Ben could use subscribe so that people can see his public updates without actually becoming a friend.\nA total of 8,000 people will carry the flame during its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July.
UK-based Chatham House says more needs to be done to protect key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal and the Turkish Straits.\nAlmost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets.\nThis, the report says, makes food supply and prices vulnerable to unforeseen crises or climate change.\nInfrastructure at the chokepoints is often old and would struggle to cope with natural disasters which are expected to grow in frequency as the planet warms, the report authors add.\nThey urge governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure, and diversify food production and stocks.\nThe report gives examples of how reliant the world is on this trade:\n"The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold," says Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors.\nThere are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food, she added.
The site at Knottingley, West Yorkshire is to burn fuel from refuse, industrial and commercial waste including wood, said operator Multifuel Energy Ltd.\nThe Â£300m plant is to create hundreds of jobs over a three-year build and should produce electricity for about 160,000 homes, it said.\nThe adjoining coal-fired Ferrybridge 'C' plant is to close in March 2016, it was announced in May.\nThe Secretary of State has granted development consent for the new plant.\nConstruction is expected to begin in 2016 with about 35 permanent jobs once it is operational.\nThe power station is expected to produce up to 90MWe of electricity annually by burning 675,000 tonnes of waste that could have ended up in landfill, said Multifuel Energy\nIt is to be built next to the newly-constructed Ferrybridge Multifuel 1 that stated operations earlier this year.\nMultifuel Energy is a joint venture between power company SSE and and waste management company Wheelabrator Technologies.
Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush.\nEx-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges.\nThe Prime Minister said it would be a day of "mixed emotions" for families.\nLast year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.\nThe inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.\nFor legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged.\nAn application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course.\nThe full list of individuals and charges are:\nThe six men charged over Hillsborough\nHillsborough: Criminal charges explained\nThe defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August.\nNo organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS.\nShe explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a "different company" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989.\nÂ£56.5m\ncost of Operation Resolve\nÂ£42m\ncost of IPCC investigation\n17,000 lines of inquiry by Operation Resolve\n11,000 statements taken by Operation Resolve\n190,000 documents reviewed by IPCC investigation\n23,000 images reviewed by IPCC investigation\nThe CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe.\nAssistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: "Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services."\nThe IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards.\nAny decision regarding WMP, which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SYP officers, will be made at a later date.\nMs Hemming made the announcement of the intended prosecutions to victims' families at a private meeting in Warrington earlier.\nShe said: "Following our careful review of the evidence, in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences.\n"Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial."\nCampaigner Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Victoria, 15, and Sarah, 19, died in the disaster, said: "There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn't been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight.\n"There are no winners in this, it doesn't bring anybody back.\n"What it does do is send a message about accountability, as we keep saying, that nobody but nobody is above the law; be it the police or anybody else."\nChairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: "This is definitely the start of the end.\n"I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability.\n"I think that's the time we'll all have peace."\nBarry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: "Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him."\nEvelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was "really happy", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion.\nPete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had "always known that accountability is the most difficult objective".\n"They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that, the rights of the defendants should be respected.\n"They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process."\nBBC News profiles of all those who died\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: "I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them."\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a "tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough".\nDr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would "lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process".\nSheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make.\nMr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors, said: "In light of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to commence criminal proceedings against David Duckenfield and Donald Denton, it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment."\nMr Metcalf declined to comment.
Met Police barrister Richard Horwell QC said suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi had no personal motive to kill.\nThe Russian state "is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot" and had "reasons aplenty" for wishing him "not only harm, but death", he said.\nUK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing.\nMr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi.\nHe died in hospital nearly three weeks later.\nThe fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks.\nHe said: "The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder."\nHowever, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder.\nDefecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as "akin to treachery", he said.\nHe also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's "many personal attacks on Putin".\nMr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death.\nHe said: "The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise.\n"We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners."\nMr Horwell said the suspects left a "trail of polonium" behind and they had "no credible answer" to the scientific evidence against them.\nWhile the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard.\nAttempts to extradite the two men have failed and they remain in Russia.\nFormer Soviet army officer Mr Kovtun has been criticised by inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen for failing to give evidence to the hearing.\nThe inquiry was adjourned until Friday.
An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon.\nOther residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside.\nAn exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday.\nIt is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s.\nThe evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device.\nThere was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation.\nCaledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay.\nCh Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock.\nLt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained.\nHe said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it.\nInverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."
Bottas, on whom Williams have a contractual hold, is Ferrari's number one option should they decide not to retain Kimi Raikkonen alongside Sebastian Vettel.\nSources close to the deal say Ferrari and Williams have discussed Bottas's transfer but have no agreement yet.\nWilliams view Button as a leading candidate should Bottas leave.\nShould the 2009 world champion join Williams in 2016, it would bring his career full circle.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton/Renault, BAR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix.\nMcLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016.\nThe team have a contractual option to retain Button, which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team's deadline to do so.\nTheir other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen, who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014, and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne, who is leading the GP2 championship. McLaren have contracts with both men.\nWilliams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future.\n"I've had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything, seriously," the 35-year-old said.\n"I just have to get my head down and concentrate on improving the car and then in a couple of months we will sit down and talk about next year."\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he "did not know" whether he would be at Williams next season.\n"Nothing is confirmed," the Finn said. "We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait."\nAlthough Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer.\nFerrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's "future is in his own hands" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel.\nThese come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso.\nFerrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes.\nRaikkonen said: "I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know.\n"Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now.\n"I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year."\nIf Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren, Williams may still look to McLaren's driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa, on whom they have an option and is expected to stay.\nMagnussen and Vandoorne could both be of interest to Williams.
John Johnston, 27, admitted taking the vehicle without consent and driving while over the legal alcohol limit.\nHe was spotted by a CCTV operator committing the offence and stopped by police in Buccleuch Street.\nAt Dumfries Sheriff Court he was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and given the driving ban.\nJohnston, who had moved from Belfast to Dumfries, committed the offence in September this year.\nHe had been staying in homeless accommodation in the town and took the roller from Brooms Road.\nHe then drove it across town in a bid to get home from a night out drinking with a friend.\n"I was just trying to find my way home," he told the court at an earlier appearance.
Stuart Campbell was arrested in the west of England on Friday following a complaint from a woman in south London.\nShe had made allegations of harassment taking place over a two-year period.\nMr Campbell, who was released on bail, said it concerned some tweets and insisted they were not threatening.  He accused the media of "innuendo" designed to encourage "speculations".\nThe blogger, a former computer games reviewer who was born in Stirling but lives in Bath, has been a vocal campaigner for Scottish independence and launched the Wings Over Scotland blog in 2011.\nOn Friday he tweeted that he would be posting less frequently than usual because of "reasons totally outwith my control (don't ask)".\nEnd of Twitter post  by @WingsScotland\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: "Police are investigating an allegation of online harassment.\n"The allegation was made after a woman, aged in her 30s, attended a south London police station. The harassment is said to have taken place over the past two years."\nMr Campbell has been bailed, pending further inquiries, to a date in mid-September.\nIn a statement on the Wings Over Scotland website, Mr Campbell responded to a report of his arrest which appeared in The Herald newspaper.\nHe said that piece "has been written for maximum innuendo to allow the wildest speculations on social media - which are of course duly taking place - but the alleged events relate entirely to some tweets from our Twitter account, none of which have been deleted and all of which are still publicly visible.\n"Nothing more sinister or serious than some tweets has occurred or been alleged to have occurred. None of the tweets involved are in ANY way threatening, not even in a joking sense. That's all we'll be saying on the subject at this time."
Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.\nAngry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.\nBut Hanson Academy claims it "communicated clearly" its expectations for this school year.\nPupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.\nStudents are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.\nPrincipal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.\nShe said in an earlier statement: "We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.\n"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.\n"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn."\nThe principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for "adult life".\nShe said: "This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.\n"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.\n"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school."\nCaren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.\nShe said: "It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather."\nShe said buying new shoes was not an easy option.\n"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important."\nDiane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.\n"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes," she said.\nAnother parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home.\nFiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: "Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00.\n"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon."\nThe school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.\nShe said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately.
Rakhmat Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm.\nHe has yet to be identified by police, who have only said that the man in custody is a 39-year-old Uzbek national.\nEven so, a picture of the man allegedly behind the attack has started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him.\nBumping into a former colleague earlier this year, he revealed he was spending his days "sleeping and smoking".\nAccording to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan in order to earn money to send home.\nHe had applied for residency in 2014, but had been informed in December 2016 that "he had four weeks to leave the country", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list.\nA few months earlier, it is claimed he had lost his job after falling asleep at work.\nHe had been working in construction, and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks late last year, helping on an asbestos removal project.\nMr Akilov was, he said, "a reserved person".\n"He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish," he told news agency AFP.\nMr Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he "partied and drank", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine.\n"He never talked about politics or religion," one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. "He didn't pray five times a day from what I know."\nA co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: "He was like any normal guy."\nOnline, it seems, it was a different story.\nHis Facebook page - which has since been taken down - is linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing.\nHe also liked a page called "Friends of Libya and Syria", which says it aims to expose "terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals" of the US, British and Arab "dictatorships".\nHowever, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova.\nDespite all this, Mr Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a "marginal character", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.
The service, held to mark the surrender of Japan at the end of World War Two, was led by Reverend Canon Bob White.\nThe event included readings from Burma veterans and a performance from the Portsmouth Military Wives Choir.\nThe service saw wreaths laid at the war memorial, including one on behalf of the city placed by the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth, councillor Frank Jonas.\nCouncil leader Donna Jones said: "It's important for communities to commemorate events such as these.\n"The ceremonies in the city provide a poignant opportunity to reflect and remember."\nA special VJ Day Choral Evensong was due to take place from 18:00 BST at Portsmouth Cathedral on Sunday.
The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.\nThe total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.\nSome children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.\nThe charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.\nChildline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.\n"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.\n"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.\n"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.\n"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."\nThe report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.\nThe group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.\nOne young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.\n"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.\n"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."\nAdvice given by young people on dealing with bullying includes:
Media playback is not supported on this device\nA World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a "state-sponsored" doping programme.\nAnd Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run.\n"This iceberg spreads in two different directions," he said. "I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with."\nCommission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.\nWarner told BBC Radio 5 live: "Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean."\n"They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out."\nWada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.\nThe IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.\nAraf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position.\nActing head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: "There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way."\nRussia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada,\nIgor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: "There is always room for improvement.\n"We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this."\nWarner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem.\nHe revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF.\nThe 323-page report said that "acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.\nThe report also said the London 2012 Olympics were "sabotaged" by "widespread inaction" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was "worse than we thought", adding that "it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system".\nWarner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition "until they put their house in order", adding: "If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp."\nHe also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that "athletics has probably got some other nations to root out".\nHe added that while "there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world.\nDuring a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: "I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia."\nOn the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of "darker days to come".\nHe said: "This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out.\n"There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore.\n"We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew?\n"No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now."\nCoe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as "alarming" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.\nThe report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be "inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as "a declaration of war on my sport" in August.\nOn Monday, Coe said that "if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them".\nBut Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\n"This cannot be a one-man crusade," Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.\n"We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\n"It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation."
Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time.\nSpecialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said.\nEarlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home.\n"In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement.\nThere were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said.\nThe incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections.\nThe deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.\nMr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.\nWhile Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.\nHowever, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.
The local authority said Richard Ellis was leaving on Friday at the end of his contract.\nCiaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are both going under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.\nStephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, said the departures were indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.\nHe said he expected further departures in the coming months.\nMr Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, and has also been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.\nMr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.\nCouncil chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism".
It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.\nSullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.\nBetween them they now own more than 85% of the club.\nSince August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.\nLast year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.
Administrators of the ACT test took the decision just hours before some 5,500 students were due to sit it.\nThe ACT is one of two entrance exams available to international and domestic students wanting to go to a US college.\nThis is not the first cheating scandal to hit the tests in East Asia.\nThe other entrance exam - the SAT - was cancelled in South Korea in 2013 because some of the questions were leaked.\nThe ACT test was due to be held at 56 test centres in both South Korea and Hong Kong on Saturday morning.\nThe Associated Press said teachers at some of Seoul's private "cram schools" said they were not notified until about an hour before the students were due to sit the test.\nACT Inc, an Iowa-based non-profit organisation that was operating the test, said it took the decision after receiving "credible evidence that test materials intended for administration in these regions have been compromised".\nThe organisation said in a statement that all students would get a refund but would only be able to resit when the tests are held again in September.
On Thursday, an investment manager and hairdresser will challenge the right of the government to start the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU without a vote in Parliament.\nLawyers will question whether Prime Minister Theresa May is entitled to act unilaterally, using powers left over from the days of medieval monarchs.\nIt could end up - in theory - with Parliament being given a means to stop Brexit.\nSo as constitutional rows go, it is box office stuff.\nOr as professor of public law at Cambridge University, Mark Elliott, puts it: "I don't rule out the possibility of the government losing the case."\nLeading the fight against the government is Gina Miller, who runs an investment firm in London, SCM Private.\nShe argues that only Parliament can make a decision that leads to the loss of her "rights" under EU law.\nShe is confident she has a strong case and is undaunted by criticism.\n"I do not back away from a fight," she says. "I'm very vocal about things and I'm no stranger to making enemies."\nShe is joined by London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney and backed by a crowd-funding campaign.\nAlso weighing into the case against the government is the group, Fair Deal for Expats.\nAround two million British citizens are believed to live and work in other EU countries.\nThe Brexit terms have not been decided but expats - some of whom were barred from voting in the referendum - fear potential repatriation and are worried about the impact on their jobs and homes as well as the ramifications for healthcare, their children's schooling and pensions.\nThree London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - have agreed to take up the case. Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: "There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that."\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is "entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the "enforced removal" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be "completely unprecedented" in a modern democracy.\n"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away," he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a "shock".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: "If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France."\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens "beyond these shores" are so fundamental that legislation is "required" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the "clear understanding" that the outcome of the referendum would be "respected".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to "give effect to the will and decision of the people".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: "To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate."\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an "advisory" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: "Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result."\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: "We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court."\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law."\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against "prerogative creep".\n"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty."\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.
The Australian, 21, beat world number 29 Querrey 6-4 6-4 in 53 minutes to progress to the second round.\nKyrgios, ranked a career-high 12th in the world, won the Japan Open on Sunday and is closing in on the top 10.\n"I was just a bit bored at times," said Kyrgios, when asked why he was not his usual vocal self against Querrey.\n"I was feeling very tired. It was just tough. I'm just tired so maybe I just wanted to get the job done."\nKyrgios said his success in Japan, and the travelling involved in playing at the Qi Zhong Stadium, an hour from Shanghai city centre, had taken its toll.\n"I didn't have the greatest sleep last night and obviously got in late the day before," he said. "The ride to the courts isn't great either."\nIt was at the Shanghai Masters last year that Kyrgios was fined $1,500 (£984) for a foul-mouthed outburst, describing the tournament a "circus".
Children in P6 and P7 will learn how to cope with change under the Healthy Me programme developed by Northern Ireland charity, Action Mental Health.\nIts chief executive David Babington said it will help prepare pupils for the stresses of the transfer test and big changes in their educational life.\nFive schools took part in a pilot.\nThe charity is now hoping the programme will be rolled out in schools across Northern Ireland.\nIt consists of "interactive workshops" in which pupils are made aware of the importance of emotional wellbeing; encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support.\nThe workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing.\nThe Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, on Friday morning.\nThe school's pastoral care co-ordinator, Helen Hamilton, is also its P7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move.\n"I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school," Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI.\n"No fault of the secondary school - they're excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they're apprehensive too and a lot of the time, that can be fed down from parents as well, they're worried about them.\n"You're going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day, and gets to know them and their wee quirks and can spot very quickly if they're out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour.\n"It's more difficult for them to pick up on those things, much as they try, so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect."\nGetting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however, and last month, thousands of P7 pupils began to sit this year's unofficial transfer tests, set by two different examination bodies, the Association of Quality Education (AQE) and GL Assessment.\nPupils have the choice to sit either test, both tests, or none, but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year, with a total of 14,681, a rise from 14,575 in 2015.\n"Transition from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P6/P7 children will help them cope with this transition," Mr Babington said.\n"Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health, so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives," the Action Mental Health boss added.\nMs Hamilton said that in the workshops, children were taught breathing exercises, and "how to relax", including how to take time out from busy after-school activity regimes.\n"We, as a school, value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who, mentally and emotionally, aren't ready to learn cannot progress, so   it's so important for us that children's social and emotional needs are met," the P7 teacher added.\nThe need to "strengthen the resilience of young people" is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland's education system, according to the chief inspector of schools, Noelle Buick.\n"All young people need to build resilience," she wrote in her  latest report, published last month..\nThe chief inspector said pupils were facing "complex challenges" because the "social context of relationships, values, attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly" in recent years.\n"It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum."
Hibs have started the process of appointing a new boss after thanking Stubbs for doing "a magnificent job" over his two-year spell.\nStubbs, 44, decided to return to England shortly after ending Hibs' 114-year wait to win the Scottish Cup.\n"They fitted in with my ambition," Stubbs said of Rotherham.\nThe Englishman has signed a three-year deal with the Millers, who reached a settlement with Hibs over compensation for Stubbs and his assistant, John Doolan.\n"Alan and his staff have done a magnificent job, with the pinnacle obviously being that historic Scottish Cup win for which every Hibernian supporter is thankful," said Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster. "We wish them every success in the future\n"The task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season.\n"We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say."\nSpeaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a "really difficult decision" to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was "the next chapter" for his career.\nRotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart.\n"I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition," he explained.\n"The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward. We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs. That has to be the aim.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n"The plan has always been to be the best I can. I wanted to manage at the very top level. I got a great opportunity at Hibernian, they've been fantastic with me, I really enjoyed my two years there.\n"I'm glad I've been able to leave on the back of a successful end to the season but now it's a new chapter and one that's very exciting for me."\nStewart insisted that, despite lengthy talks with Hibs over compensation - and Stubbs and Doolan ultimately resigning from their posts - relations between the two clubs were fine. And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.\n"Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs," Stewart said. "My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely.\n"We've followed Alan's career. He was on the radar months ago, the timing was right and we took the opportunity. I like the drive, the leadership.\n"Football is about moving around. Hibs have been fantastic, Alan's told me how good they've been up there and it's sad they've lost a manager and Rotherham gained him. We look forward now to getting ready for next season."
Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.\nHis lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.\nThe policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.\nThe death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.\nOfficers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.\nPolice had initially said the vehicle reversed "aggressively" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.\nHe was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.\n"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office," Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.\nThe teenager was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend".\nRoy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.\nIf convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: "We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas]."
Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of Saturday's match against Bournemouth after Bob Bradley's sacking.\nSwansea want to appoint their new boss as soon as possible, with ex-Derby manager Paul Clement the first choice.\n"We've got to go with somebody who will to get us out of trouble," he said.\n"If we were to go down - and there's obviously that possibility - you look at the Championship and it seems to have got a lot stronger. It's not a foregone conclusion [to go straight back up].\n"I know Norwich and Burnley have done it but it's difficult. Newcastle look like they'll do it but they're a big, powerful club who can hang on to a lot of their top players. I'm not sure we'd be able to do that.\n"If we go down, it's going to be tough to get back."\nSwansea were promoted to the Premier League in 2011 and quickly established a reputation as a well-run club with a team that played exciting, possession-based football.\nTheir promotion capped a remarkable rise from the brink of bankruptcy a decade earlier and almost being relegated out of the Football League altogether in 2003.\nCurtis - a former player who was at the club throughout their rise up the divisions - believes the Swans have not been the same since Michael Laudrup left in 2014.\n"I think we have [lost our way]. It's just the change of management all the time," Curtis added.\n"The best eras were Roberto Martinez, Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. But we've probably lost a bit of the 'Swansea Way'. It has been diluted.\n"We've lost quite a few players too but have we adequately replaced them?"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCurtis believes the current Swansea squad is good enough to stay up, and the 62-year-old reminds every new signing of how far the club has come.\n"I know a lot of the foreign boys have seen [the documentary] Jack to a King. So they've got a brief history of where we were and where we are now," he said.\n"They might not be 100% passionate about it but they know where we came from and how important it is [to stay up]. Not just for the club but for the whole area."
The 25-year-old wing has crossed codes from Super League side Wigan Warriors, in arguably the most high-profile switch since Sam Burgess' move to Bath.\nBurgess' time in union only lasted a year, but Chorley-born Charnley is hoping he can take to the game more naturally.\n"I just want to learn it and not have to ask where I should be stood. I just want to have it free-flowing," he told BBC Sport.\nSince his move to Sale was announced in March, Charnley has been to the AJ Bell Stadium to watch the team as much as possible.\nWith his focus on league as a youngster, he did not grow up watching the Premiership, Six Nations or England internationals.\n"I've wanted to try union for a while," he added.\n"I've been lucky enough to be successful in league and achieve things that not many people can achieve so when the opportunity came to switch codes, I couldn't turn it down.\n"I've been watching a lot of games and analysing it. It is one of those where I need to watch as much as I can as I need to know what I need to be doing."\nCharnley said he was having to adapt to a different way of training and the pace of the game in union.\n"I was doing some clearing out the other day and it hurt my neck," Charnley said with a wry smile.\n"It is getting my body used to it. I'm used to running between two people and getting up and down and this is different.\n"It's good, it's a new challenge and I'm excited for it all."\nHe signed off with his hometown club in the perfect way, scoring a try at the Grand Final at Old Trafford as Wigan beat Warrington 12-6 last month.\nHis stats in rugby league were staggering - 165 tries in 176 appearances - and Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond does not want to suppress that natural ability to cross the whitewash.\n"We're not going to take away anything that he has already got, we can't enhance that at all at the moment," said 48-year-old ex-Sale hooker Diamond.\n"We have a good management structure here. We understand what we're bringing from one sport to another and the differences in the codes.\n"We have to settle him in; we don't want to rush him in. I think he will be nothing like the Sam Burgess affair that happened."\nThere is a long line of Wigan players moving to union, and in recent times both Chris Ashton and Joel Tomkins have become cross-code internationals, but still the most successful was Jason Robinson's switch.\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones has spoken about Charnley as having the ability to join the list of players who have represented their country in both codes.\n"The potential is there, without a doubt," former Sharks and England winger Mark Cueto told North West Tonight.\n"You don't want to pile the pressure on him but he has the ability to do it, and I'm sure he will.\n"He has such a good career so far, so as a long as he does that in a Sale shirt then he is always going to have a sniff."\nAsked if he thought about running out at Twickenham, Charnley added: "Any player wants to play for their country. You want to put that jersey on.\n"If I'm lucky enough to be successful enough to get picked then it will be a nice thing on my CV."

The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.\nInvestigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.\nIt is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.\nOfficers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.\nDet Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.\n"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible."
In 2014, Sarah Rochira published the results of a major review of the experience of care home residents.\nThe use of antipsychotic drugs was a recurrent theme which she has branded a "national scandal".\nHealth boards and care homes have said changes are being made.\nThe commissioner is asking them to show significant improvements in practice.\n"I know professionals don't like this phrase, but across Wales older people in care homes, through the inappropriate use of these drugs, are being 'chemically coshed'. That's the reality of it.\n"It is a national scandal. I made that clear when I published my review. I was very clear I would come back and look for evidence of changes and I've now begun that process.\n"I will publish the findings from the health boards later this year and I cannot be any clearer in my expectation that they understand how inappropriate the current situation is and that they can evidence real progress."\nAntipsychotic drugs are primarily used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\nA survey last November by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found nearly one in five - 18% - of dementia patients were being prescribed antipsychotics.\nThe Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Wales published its own report into the use of medicines in care homes following the Ms Rochira's report.\nThe society's director in Wales, Mair Davies, told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme that there were examples of expert practice.\n"What we need is to make sure that happens in every care home in Wales," she said.\nSteve Ford, the dementia care lead for Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 independent care homes in Wales, believes progress is being made.\n"We need to look at the underlying reasons for unwanted behaviour that challenges, rather than picking up the phone to the GP and requesting those prescriptions," he said.
The males, two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London, were reported missing in March amid fears they were planning to travel to Syria.\nThey were stopped by Turkish officials and arrested on their return to the UK.\nThe teenagers, who have not been named, were bailed while police carried out further inquiries.\nScotland Yard said they were all released without charge on Monday 8 June.\nIt is understood they had flown to the Turkish city of Istanbul from Barcelona in Spain. The teenagers were all detained at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport.\nTheir arrests came weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three London schoolgirls who travelled to Istanbul on their journey to Syria.\nShamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 - all from east London - took flights to Istanbul in February, from where it is feared they travelled to join Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria.\nIS has taken over large swathes of Syria and Iraq, with the aim of establishing a "caliphate", a state ruled by a single political and religious leader according to Islamic law.

The animal had been shot twice in the shoulder and once in its left back leg, which vets had to amputate.\nThe charity said the one-year-old cat was "incredibly lucky" to survive.\nLast year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons, but a majority of responders opposed the plan.\nOne-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA.\nMrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again.\n"The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged," she said.\n"She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible.\n"The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire."\nShe added: "There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know."\nScottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: "Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm.\n"This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency."\nHe added: "The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly."\nLast year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan.\nUnder the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.\nA total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as "draconian" and "heavy-handed". A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough.\nThe Scottish SPCA urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
