{"document": "Fast forward about 20 years, and it's fair to say he has done just that.\nThe business he runs, Frasers Hospitality, is one of the world's biggest providers of high-end serviced apartments. Its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities, as well as financial hubs across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nBut it almost didn't get off the ground.\nWhen Mr Choe was appointed to launch and lead the company, Asia was booming; the tiger economies of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were expanding rapidly.\nBut as Frasers prepared to open its first two properties in Singapore, the Asian financial crisis hit.\nIt was 1997. Currencies went into freefall. Suddenly, people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling.\nMr Choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm, because when the properties opened they might not get paid.\n\"It was really that serious,\" he says. \"I remember tearing up because they said 'let's open it, let's open it whether you can pay us or not'.\"\nSurvival, Mr Choe admits, came through a bit of luck, and the misfortune of others.\nHe had convinced the board at parent firm, property group Frasers Centrepoint, to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in Singapore was easier.\nBut he also sensed it was a big, untapped market. And at the time of the crisis, it proved to be exactly what customers wanted.\n\"As we were going through this difficult patch, there were protests and riots in Jakarta,\" he says. \"A lot of companies like Microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of Jakarta.\"\nFrasers' 412 apartments were quickly in demand. Occupancy soon hit 70%, and then 90%.\nExplaining the popularity of serviced apartments, Mr Choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days, they happily stay in hotels, but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months, the walls of hotel rooms \"close in on you\".\nBut now, Mr Choe, 57, faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of Airbnb.\n\"The way to tackle Airbnb is not to ignore it. I will never underestimate Airbnb,\" he says.\nThere's been no significant impact on Frasers yet. Big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments, he says, because they can guarantee a level of safety and security. But that is likely to change, Mr Choe admits.\n\"I have two daughters who to my chagrin use Airbnb,\" he says. \"We took a family trip to Florence and I stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel, but paid a bundle for it.\n\"When my daughter joined us, she said, 'I'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros'. We paid about 330 euros.\n\"I asked why they stayed at Airbnb. They say 'it's like a surprise, it's part of the adventure'.\"\nAnd so now, Mr Choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to Frasers.\nWhile neutral colours, beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments, many customers want something different, and this is shaping Fraser's strategy.\nIn 2015 it bought Malmaison Hotel du Vin, a UK hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels.\nThat has taken them beyond financial centres, including to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Or, an intrepid traveller with $500 (\u00c2\u00a3325) to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in Oxford.\nAnd Frasers has launched the Capri sub-brand - whose website promises \"inspiring art and inspirational tech\".\nOn a day-to-day basis Mr Choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man, who - having been given a scholarship by the Shangri-La hotel group to study at Cornell University in the US - came back to Asia to learn about the hospitality industry.\n\"They put me in every department conceivable. I remember one of the toughest jobs I had was in the butchery. I had to carve an entire cow. For one month, I could not eat meat.\n\"I'm thankful for those experiences. When you step into a hotel, you immediately pick up what works and what doesn't work.\n\"When I see the check-in staff walking more than three steps, I know the counter is set up wrong.\n\"It's like a cockpit. Can you imagine if the pilot had to turn around when he flies?\"\nMore The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:\nThe 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich\nThe snacks boss with an appetite for success\nTaking his own path: The world's leading maze designer\nMr Choe adds that loyalty is very important to him, and he remains tremendously grateful to staff who have stayed with him.\n\"I will always respect and remember those who gave up their jobs to join me,\" he says.\nThis loyalty is something that Mr Choe has earned, according to Donald MacLaurin, associate professor at Singapore Institute of Technology, and specialist in the hospitality sector.\nMr MacLaurin points out that Mr Choe introduced a five-day working week, in a part of the world where six days is common, thereby showing \"a focus on quality of life issues for employees\".\nThe associate professor adds says the early success of the business was remarkable given the timing of its launch.\nFast forward to today and the company is now on track to operate 30,000 serviced apartments globally by 2019. That success, say Mr Choe's admirers, should make him something of a visionary.\nFollow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter.", "id": "40453444"}

{"document": "The Sunday Times says the missile veered off course during a test in June last year - weeks before the Commons voted to spend \u00a340bn renewing Trident.\nQuestioned by Andrew Marr, the PM refused to say four times if she had known about the test ahead of the vote.\nThe SNP's Nicola Sturgeon called for a \"full disclosure\" of what happened.\nAccording to the Sunday Times, an unarmed Trident II D5 missile veered off in the wrong direction towards the US - instead of towards Africa - when it was launched from a British submarine off the coast of Florida.\nIn July - days after Mrs May had become prime minister - MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of replacing Trident.\nDuring the debate, Mrs May told MPs it would be \"an act of gross irresponsibility\" for the UK to abandon its nuclear weapons.\nMPs backed its renewal by 472 votes to 117. However, all 52 SNP MPs voted against it - as did Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nWhen asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show whether she had known then that a misfire had happened, Mrs May said: \"I have absolute faith in our Trident missiles.\n\"When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident.\"\nShe was asked a further three times - but did not answer the questions.\nThe Ministry of Defence did not give details of the test process but said it had been a success.\nScottish First Minister, Mrs Sturgeon - a long-standing opponent of Trident, whose submarines are based at Faslane, on the River Clyde - said the apparent misfire was a \"hugely serious issue\".\nShe tweeted: \"There should be full disclosure of what happened, who knew what/when, and why the House of Commons wasn't told.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the reports called for \"a serious discussion\".\nHe told Sky News: \"It's a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn't armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been.\"\nNia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said it was \"completely unacceptable\" that Mrs May had \"side-stepped\" questions.\nShe called for the prime minister to give \"a full explanation\" to Parliament on Monday.\nAdmiral Lord West, the Labour peer and ex-Royal Navy officer, said it was \"bizarre and stupid\" to not tell anyone about the test.\nThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) described reports of a misfire as a \"very serious failure\".\n\"There's absolutely no doubt that this would have impacted on the debate in Parliament on Trident replacement,\" its general secretary Kate Hudson said.\nA statement issued by both Downing Street and the MoD said the capability and effectiveness of Trident was \"unquestionable\".\n\"In June the Royal Navy conducted a routine, unarmed Trident missile test launch from HMS Vengeance, as part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew.\n\"Vengeance and her crew were successfully tested and certified, allowing Vengeance to return into service. We have absolute confidence in our independent nuclear deterrent.\"\nThe Sunday Times says the test fire was launched from HMS Vengeance.\nIt says the Trident II D5 missile was intended to be fired 5,600 miles (9,012 km) to a sea target off the west coast of Africa but veered towards the US.\nThe cause remains top secret, the paper says, but it quotes a senior naval source as saying the missile suffered an in-flight malfunction after launching out of the water.\nHMS Vengeance, one of the UK's four Vanguard-class submarines, returned to sea for trials in December 2015 after a \u00a3350m refit, which included the installation of new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems.\nAccording to the Sunday Times, it is expected that Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will be called to the Commons to answer questions from MPs.\nBBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said while the MoD has described the test as a success for the crew and the boat, it has not denied the report that the missile itself might have veered off course.\nIn the past the MoD has issued a press release and video of successful tests but its silence on this occasion has raised questions as to whether any fault was deliberately kept quiet ahead of the key vote, our correspondent added.\nThe Trident system was acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s as a replacement for the Polaris missile system, which the UK had possessed since the 1960s.\nTrident came into use in the 1990s. There are three parts to it - submarines, missiles and warheads. Although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely.\nThe current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the late 2020s.\nA guide to the Trident debate", "id": "38711418"}

{"document": "\"Fracking\" involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure.\nThe joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms follow best practice and rules are enforced.\nExploratory fracking is being mooted in at least seven sites around the UK.\nThe report was commissioned by the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, following the decision last year to halt the UK's most advanced project, in Lancashire, after fracking caused small earth tremors.\n\"Our main conclusions are that the environmental risks of hydraulic fracturing for shale can can be safely managed provided there is best practice observed and provided it's enforced through strong regulation,\" said the report's chair, Prof Robert Mair from Cambridge University.\n\"The UK regulatory system is up to the job for the present very small scale exploration activities, but there would need to be strengthening of the regulators if the government decides to proceed with more shale gas extraction, particularly at the production stage,\" he told BBC News.\nThe report contains 10 top-line recommendations for strengthening regulations, including:\nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves drilling down into shale formations and fracturing the rock using explosives or hydraulic pressure.\nWater is pumped in containing sand particles that prop open the cracks in the shale, allowing the gas out, and a tiny amount of chemicals.\nIn the US, concerns have been raised that the gas or the chemicals can enter drinking water supplies.\nHowever, the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is \"very low\" - provided that fracking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres, a long way below the level of aquifers, and that the wells are properly constructed.\nEach well is lined with layers of steel and cement; and if this stays intact, the scientists conclude, gas leakage should not be a problem.\nThey also say that with good management of waste water, chemical contamination should be avoided; they criticise the US practice of leaving it in open ponds, which would not be permitted in the UK.\nThe report says the risk that fracking will generate significant seismic events is also small.\nThe actual explosions are far too small to be noticed at the surface, said Prof Zoe Shipton from the University of Strathclyde.\n\"If the fluid moves into existing faults in the rock that are close to slipping anyway, you'll bring that slippage forward in time,\" she said.\n\"But the Magnitude 2.3 event in Blackpool last year - that is like a lorry going past your house - in fact the British Geological Survey can't measure below Magnitude 2 in towns because of the traffic.\"\nThe European industry is in its infancy compared with the US, and governments' views on the technology are mixed.\nFracking has been banned in France, but countries such as Poland are taking a strong interest.\nUK ministers see shale gas as a way of cheaply bridging the transition to a low-carbon fuel mix, despite calculations showing that widespread adoption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would mean future UK governments missing their legally-binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\nProf Mair said climate impacts were outside his remit, but a detailed look at the issue should happen at some stage.\n\"The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" he said.\n\"It's a very wide issue - energy policy, CO2 reduction, all of that needs to be looked at - and gas in general is part of that.\"\nFollow Richard  \n          on Twitter", "id": "18611647"}

I call it magic.\nAnd funny, too. Your lyrics have proper punchlines.\nYeah, quite a few!\nDo you work hard on them?\nIt varies, depending on what it is I'm creating. A lot of the time I don't even write the bars. It's all in my head, really.\nApparently you used to read the dictionary as a child?\nThat is true, yeah!\nWhat's your favourite word?\nAntidisestablishmentarianism. It's one of the longest words in the English language.\nHave you ever tried to get it into a song?\nI've been asked and I'm definitely working on it! It might not fit on a single cover, but it could definitely fit in a lyric.\nWhat triggered your interest in words?\nIt was learning about synonyms that did it for me. I was like, \"Wow, you can use another word to mean the same thing as this word?\" It just went crazy from there.\nWhen did you first perform in public?\nOoh\u2026 The first time I performed in public? To be fair, growing up I was always performing. It didn't have to be on a stage. It could be a family event and I would just make it about me, somehow. I would perform anywhere. Going up in a lift, on the side of a road, wherever.\nOne of your teachers said you were the most entertaining pupil she ever had.\nYeah, that was touching\u2026 And actually, I do agree.\nThere's a fine line between \"entertaining\" and \"troublemaker\". How often did you end up on the wrong side?\nHa ha! Some days it did tip over into what some teachers would call \"disruptive\". But I thought it was creative.\nWhat did you study at university?\nMusic and music management. It was very helpful when signing my deal - because there were things I definitely wouldn't have had a clue about prior to taking that course.\nAt the same time as studying, you were working at a betting shop and making music in your spare time. Did you get any sleep?\nNah, barely. All my free time was up in the studio. I just had a feeling I was giving music my spare time, rather than my time. It got to a point where it felt very weird and I thought, \"This is all the wrong way round. I'm getting too comfortable at work and keeping music as a little side thing.\"\nI needed to give it my all to actually get the results that I wanted.\nYour dad was an MC too. How instrumental was he in your musical education?\nHe played a huge part in all of this. He had quite an eclectic music taste, but there was loads of Sizzla, Buju Banton, a lot of the old-school reggae guys. That's where that part of my musical personality comes from.\nWho were the MCs you listened to growing up?\nIn terms of MCs and rappers, it was definitely a lot of the hip-hop legends, like Busta, Eminem, Missy, Lil Kim. But I wasn't just inspired by MCs. I was a huge Spice Girls fan, too.\nWhich one were you?\nThey called me Wavey Spice! [Wavey is London slang for cool/good.]\nThere weren't many female MCs in the UK to look up to.\nWell, there was Ms Dynamite. Seeing what she was able to achieve was inspiring.\nHow do you feel about the current wave of female MCs?\nIt's a good time and hopefully it'll continue to build.\nWhy do you think it's happening now?\nProbably me! I bringing them with me!\nI saw a freestyle you recorded for SB:TV where you said you'd been told to \"get naked and wear thongs\" to sell records. Was that based on real experience?\nIt's from personal experience as well as people that have told me stories. As women in this male-dominated field, we've all been approached with something along those lines at one point. It happens, but we have to be able to overcome it.\nI need to ask about the video to Station... I was worried you might die on the train tracks.\nA few people were, including my mum.\nHow dangerous was it?\nIt was literally by chance that we survived. There was no real planning. We didn't even get permission.\nRecently I found out we got the train times wrong. The train that would have been coming on the other side was actually due at the time we got off the tracks\u2026 We thought we had a good five minutes spare, but we had seconds.\nThe other notable thing about that video, and Skwod too, is how much charisma you have. Were you always a natural in front of the camera?\nYeah, basically. I'm in my element. I'm doing the thing I love and I'm being able to share that with people.\nThis summer, you got to go to Rio for a grime showcase at the British embassy. What was that like?\nThat was amazing. I loved Rio. Just to be part of the Olympics was extra-special, again with my squad. I look forward to going again.\nYou'd expect the British embassy to choose something more boring, like Sting...\nWell, I'm actually a huge Sting fan. I wouldn't call him boring, but I get what you mean. It was definitely good to bring my sound over there.\nSo what's your plan for 2017?\nIt's going to be filled with a lot of music, a lot of visuals. If you thought this year was the Nadia Rose takeover, you have no idea!\nWhat's your biggest ambition?\nI definitely need a Grammy under me belt. One at least. At the very least.

Each battery is made up of four launchers and two control vehicles.\nTwo of the the launchers appear to have been erected, says the report.\nAn image taken of the site on 3 February shows the beach empty.\nFox News quoted a US defence official as saying the missiles appeared to be the HQ-9 air defence system, with a range of about 200km (125 miles).\nChina's deployment of long-range surface-to-air missiles to the South China Sea is a clear escalation, but it is not a surprise.\nNor is it China's first deployment of advanced military technology to Woody Island (Yongxing Dao).

{"document": "One Syrian boy happily shows a model he has made out of cardboard - a neat house, complete with a shiny red roof, bright blue walls and tiny windows that swing open.\nIt is a bitter sweet achievement.\nHe has designed his dream house from memory of a time before, for there are no windows to open here.\nWe are in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, and the schoolroom in this camp, like all the 40 or so other buildings, is made of wooden frames on concrete floors, covered in plastic sheeting.\nMuch of it is decorated with incongruous advertising pictures, black-and-white shots of men in sunglasses and designer stubble.\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron wants to take refugees directly from camps like this in the Middle East, rather than absorb the people who have already made the journey to Hungary, Greece or Italy.\nThe logic is that it will stop people making the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean.\nIt makes a lot of sense. But it may already be too little, and far too late. Taking 4,000 more people each year until 2020 will hardly dent the problem.\nThe border with Syria is only a few miles across the hill rising above the camp.\nThe people here can still hear the war they fled, as President Bashar al-Assad's bombs land on a besieged town.\nLife is definitely safer this side of the border. But it is not comfortable.\nThere are rats, the drinking water is dirty, and while it is now stifling under the September Sun, in winter the snow is 3ft (1m) high and they freeze.\nMore importantly, life is getting worse and the pressure to leave Lebanon is growing all the time.\nOne man, Mzead al-Ali, tells me he is on the brink of following those who have made the perilous exodus, leaving his wife and four children, including two seven-month-old twins, behind in the camp, so he can send them money.\nHis brother left three days ago for Turkey. They haven't heard from him since he went, and don't know if he is safe.\nHis mother wants to talk about it but has to keep pressing her hands flat against her face, to stop the tears.\nThis is not, according to the government here, a refugee camp  but a temporary settlement, and there are thousands like it.\nLebanon is a country of four million people, and it now hosts well over a million refugees from its war-riven bigger neighbour.\nA third live in camps like this, but life is difficult also for others who have more conventional accommodation.\nThe burden on Lebanon is nearly unbearable, as a government minister told me, and there are rising tensions.\nThe refugees' presence puts pressure on the already dubious efficiency of water and electricity, schooling and health care.\nThe charities are running out of money, and food aid has been slashed and slashed again. It is due to be cut again soon.\nRefugees can't get work permits so can't earn money for the papers they need to renew every year - the $200 (\u00c2\u00a3130) is out of sight for most of them.\nAlmost unbelievably, they have to pay rent for their camps, and they are not allowed to expand them, even though the population is steadily growing.\nThe borders are closed, so they can't go back and relatives can't join them.\nThe schoolroom is funded with aid from Britain.\nIt is part of the UK government's case that while it make take fewer refugees than other countries, it spends far more in helping people in the Middle East.\nBut it is noticeable that the schoolroom is decorated with crayon drawings in black, yellow and red - the German flag.\n\"Next time you come, we have a British flag,\" says Mr al-Ali, slightly embarrassed.\nHe says he wants German Chancellor Angela Merkel to send a big ship to take them all to Europe.\nThere is anger here that the rich Gulf States and Saudi Arabia have done next to nothing to help settle refugees and seem oblivious to the fact that some might think it their responsibility before Europe's.\nFor this crisis raises some interesting questions about leadership.\nGermany's latest intervention is fascinating, reflecting a change in attitude that means it is more confident of making foreign policy gestures intended to show leadership in Europe, and which demonstrate a wish to change the world through instruments other than war.\nThere is also a new impatience with other EU members, and a willingness to lead through example rather than wait for agreement.\nGermany, where for a long time foreign workers have been made to feel unloved, wants to show itself as open to the world, a successful and dynamic economy that can absorb, indeed needs, a new workforce.\nBut it may have unintended consequences.\nEarlier this week, Lebanon's morning newspaper, the Daily Star, carried an advert by the Danish government, warning it had toughened up its asylum rules and cut benefits to migrants.\nThe Danes will not be the only ones who worry about the downside of German generosity.\nPeople I met in Lebanon say those who would like to leave Iraq and Afghanistan have heard a message - now is the time to go to Europe, before there is another change of mood and the drawbridge goes up again.\nSo it is little wonder people in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) feel Mr Cameron may be onto something - it makes sense processing people here, rather than luring them into a dangerous journey.\nBut while the British policy was announced last week and fleshed out in the Commons on Monday, no-one in Lebanon has heard anything officially.\nThe generous feel it will take a while, the cynical that it is all about the headlines.\nWednesday's announcement on migrant quotas was focused solely on dealing with the crisis within Europe, but there has not even been a whisper of a coordinated European approach using camps in the Middle East, which is what would seem to make the most sense.\nIt is the death of one toddler on a Turkish shore and the sight of thousands of people dragging themselves across Europe that has focused the minds of politicians on this crisis on our continent.\nThere is  a clear need, somehow, to absorb - or, some might argue, return - these people.\nBut the far greater crisis is elsewhere, and indeed is also in the future.\nMass migration is not just the by-product of one horrible war, or even several conflicts and vile regimes but, in part, the result of the growing aspirations, understanding and opportunity that globalisation brings.\nBiafra did not send thousands of the dispossessed into Europe.\nOn 30 May 1967, the head of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, Col Emeka Ojukwu, unilaterally declared the independent Republic of Biafra.\nThe Biafran forces were pushed back after initial military gains.\nMore than two years later, after one million civilians had died in fighting and from famine, Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria.\nThirty years ago, the Ethiopian famine produced Live Aid - it meant thousands of people packing into a concert venue in central London for a day, not thousands of the displaced crowding on to trains and lorries for years.\nWhen the cities and farmlands of millions people disappear under the waves, it will not be so.\nWhen nations fight wars over precious water, populations will march, not in protest, but to happier lands.\nIt is genuinely hard for politicians in democracies to think beyond four-year cycles, and the next day's headlines.\nBut perhaps it is time they made a start.\nYou can listen to our programme from Beirut here.", "id": "34188152"}

This process could take decades.\nInstead, researchers from Switzerland and China looked at geological maps of the country.\nDr Annette Johnson, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and a co-author of the study, explained: \"In the last few years the amount of geospatial information - electronic maps - that's become available is large. You have information such as climate data, land use, and distance to the river or elevation.\"\nUsing this information, and by looking at the types of rocks present in the country, and in particular their age, the researchers pinpointed the regions where the toxic element is most likely to be found.\nTheir findings suggest that 19.6 million people in China could be exposed to unsafe levels in their drinking water, including some living in areas areas not previously thought to be at risk.\nDr Johnson told the BBC World Service programme Science in Action: \"They are areas along river basins where there is irrigation and agriculture, including areas that were known previously such as the Huhhot basin in Inner Mongolia, but there are also new areas in the central Sichuan province and along the east coast.\"\nThe researchers say the findings could help the Chinese authorities with their well-screening programmes.\nDr Johnson explained: \"What it is very important to do is to go to the areas that are hotspots and screen those first. The chances are you will find more contaminated wells than wells that are not contaminated.\n\"And in the other areas, you still have to make sure you do screening for arsenic, but it is probably not such a high priority.\"\nWells that are contaminated could be either treated or taken out of use, she added.\nThe researchers believe this new prediction method could used elsewhere around the world.\nArsenic contamination of groundwater is found in central Europe, South America, parts of the US and Asia.\nBut one country that could benefit is Bangladesh, where arsenic poisoning has been described by the World Health Organization as a \"public health emergency\".\nIt is estimated that between 35 million and 77 million people there are at risk of drinking contaminated water.", "id": "23794644"}

Lambie's second three-pointer regained the lead for the visitors at 9-7.\nGradually, England found the balance between pragmatism and adventure. Youngs' kicking and sniping helped regain the initiative, Farrell landed a penalty and then the men in white struck again.\nWith the ball going through hands again Daly kicked long from inside his own half, May forced JP Pietersen into a fumble, Brown kicked on and second row Lawes dived on the loose ball as it rolled over the try-line.\nFarrell added the conversion and then Daly marked the occasion of his first England start with a monstrous penalty from halfway for a lead of 20-9 at the interval.\nNow it was England with the power, Billy Vunipola sucking in tacklers with his carrying, the Springboks' defence stretched and then fatally weakened.\nYoungs spotted space around the fringes on the opposition 22, beat blind-side flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit with an outrageous dummy and found Ford on his right shoulder to put his fly-half away for their side's third try.\nSouth Africa came into the match having lost four of their past five games, and shipped a half-century of points at home to the All Blacks in their last outing.\nA breakaway try from replacement Johan Goosen briefly gave them hope, but when Youngs foxed Du Toit with a replica dummy to send Farrell away, England's authority was once again absolute.\nWillie le Roux crossed late in the left-hand corner to underline England's need to tighten their defence.\nBut in difficult conditions, this was an accomplished display, and with Fiji in London next weekend, Jones will expect that flawless record to be extended further still.\nA perfect scrum-half's performance in conditions like this - precision box-kicking, snappy passes to his big ball-carriers, picking the ideal moments to snipe and break.\nEngland captain Dylan Hartley: \"There's plenty to work on, so that keeps us grounded.

He strove hard and determinedly in life to advance Singapore, and not for his place in history, or leaving a great legacy,\" she wrote.\nShe later accused the government of wanting to \"glorify my father\", and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited. The paper, The Straits Times, strongly denied her claims of censorship.\nIn a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper's editors, she wrote that her brother \"has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after LKY died... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty, LKY's daughter will not allow LKY's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son.\"\nOne Sunday, the prime minister  released a statement saying her accusations were \"completely untrue\", adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities \"were generally appropriate\".\nIn Singapore, Lee's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name, and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine.\nIn a 1984 interview, Lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in Singapore, saying: \"The danger... is that when the leader dies, you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another.\"\nThe Lee siblings' squabble has divided public opinions, with many taking to their Facebook pages to weigh in.\nSome agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful.\n\"If he doesn't want to be hero worshipped then we shouldn't no matter what Singaporeans want. LKY has already given a lot to us. Let him rest in peace,\" said commenter Mohammad Nizam Abdul Kadir.\n\"The best way we can remember him is to continue as a united, multi-racial, progressive country. Uphold his values and principles,\" said another called Mano Sabnani.\nBut others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens, many of whom still feel a personal connection to Lee.\n\"I am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to Singapore. I would humbly ask Ms Lee Wei Ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too,\" said Daniel Ng.\nCarol Sim said: \"Ms Lee has failed to understand that LKY does not belong to her alone.

{"document": "Horror stories have been handed down the generations about the mysterious site, known as Deadman's Island, so the BBC's Inside Out South East programme took a boat across to investigate whether any of the rumours were true.\nLots of people have since been talking about it on social media sites.\nHere are the answers to six things you wanted to know.\n1. Where is Deadman's Island and who owns it?\nIt lies at the mouth of The Swale, opposite the town of Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, off the north Kent coast.\nThe uninhabited mudbank is owned by Natural England, who lease it to two people.\nThe wetland site is protected land, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and recognised to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention.\nIt is also an important bird breeding and nesting site.\n2. Can anyone visit?\nNo, the island is completely out of bounds to the public.\nThe Inside Out team was only allowed to visit after receiving permission from the leaseholder and because it was not the bird breeding season.\n3. Who were the people buried there?\nThe remains are believed to be those of men and boys who died of contagious diseases on board floating prisons, known as prison hulks, which were moored off the Isle of Sheppey more than 200 years ago.\nThey were buried in unmarked coffins in six feet of mud.\n4. Why are their remains being exposed?\nRising sea levels and coastal erosion over the years have begun to slowly wash away their final resting place, leaving wooden coffins and skeletal remains sticking out of the mud.\nThey are only visible when the tide is out.\n5. Will the bodies be reburied?\nThe remains are being washed out into the sea, and would be difficult to re-bury.\nCoincidentally, during the Napoleonic wars, many French prisoners of war were held around the coast at Chatham, with those who died buried on the nearby marshes.\nWhen erosion started to reveal the bodies, they were exhumed and reburied on St Mary's Island.\nWhen the land was later needed for redevelopment, they were disinterred again and reburied at St George's Church, now the St George's Centre, at Chatham Maritime.\n6. Have archaeologists visited the island?\nKent archaeologist Dr Paul Wilkinson was taken to the island by Inside Out, and confirmed the bones were human remains.\nIt is not known if any archaeologists have surveyed the area as nothing has been made public.\nYou can see the full story on Inside Out, on BBC One South East and London on Monday 30 January at 19:30 GMT, and later on the BBC iPlayer.", "id": "38797543"}

{"document": "Mr Spencer, head of Xbox, said the console, then codenamed Project Scorpio, \u201cmust deliver true 4K gaming and high-fidelity VR [virtual reality]\u201d.\nThe Xbox One X, as it will now be known, looks set to deliver on that first promise of 4K visuals. But on the second? Virtual reality didn\u2019t get a single mention at the company\u2019s bonanza press event on Sunday.\nSo what\u2019s happening?\nI think it\u2019s fair, despite the mild protests of his PR team afterwards, to characterise Mr Spencer as something of a virtual reality sceptic - at least for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to your customers and what they are actually looking for,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get many questions about consoles and mixed reality in the living room.\n\"When I do this on my PC, I\u2019m closer to my PC - that seems to be a much more user-friendly scenario today.\u201d\nWhat he\u2019s saying is - the technology isn\u2019t quite there yet, in his view. Contrast that with Sony, whose PlayStation VR has sold more than one million headsets since being launched this time last year.\nYou\u2019ll also notice that Mr Spencer talks about \u201cmixed\u201d reality, not \u201cvirtual\u201d. The strategy from the very top at Microsoft is not in virtual worlds, but in augmented ones, where digital images are overlaid on to the real world.\nMicrosoft's Hololens augmented reality headset device, though still in its infancy, is perhaps the most exciting piece of consumer technology in development today - and Mr Spencer seems to buy into its potential, more so than VR.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we see the most interest from customers and developers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are believers in mixed reality. And mixed reality on the PC is something we\u2019re focused on.\u201d\nMr Spencer drew comparisons with Kinect, the motion-control device Microsoft released for the Xbox in 2010. Kinect was at first considered a big hit and around 24 million were eventually sold.\nThere are signs that Hololens and mixed reality could follow that same early trajectory, Mr Spencer said.\n\u201cWe went through Kinect. We\u2019ve seen what new ecosystems feel like when they\u2019re catching momentum and really growing. We see that happening on Windows with mixed reality - that\u2019s going to be our focus.\u201d\nBut that Kinect comparison isn\u2019t exactly ideal. Despite its early success - it was recognised by Guinness as the fastest selling consumer electronics device in history - you won\u2019t see gamers excitedly gathering around a Kinect at E3 this year, and Microsoft has now abandoned bundling in the Kinect with the Xbox One console.\nIt was an innovative technology that ultimately lacked a practical application. In other words: it just didn\u2019t really catch on.\nWill virtual reality? If it does - Microsoft's choice to go down the mixed reality road could leave the Xbox platform bereft of gaming\u2019s next big thing.", "id": "40245539"}

But if we needed reminding that nothing in space is routine then this explosion has brought that message home in spectacular fashion.\nThe US space agency \"seeded\" development of Antares - and the supply ship it launches, Cygnus - by giving incentive payments to manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation, to help them develop a low-cost, commercial follow-on to fill the cargo gap left by the retired space shuttles.\nThe blast is likely to have seriously damaged the launch pad and support infrastructure, meaning that even if the fault is quickly identified and corrected, restarting Antares flights again may take a long time.\nHowever, there should be no immediate threat to supplies for astronauts on the space station. The Cygnus cargo ship that was on top of the Antares is one of a fleet of vehicles that are used in this role. These other robotic vessels, launched atop other rockets, will now have to pick up the slack.\nThere is no doubting the explosion is a major setback for Orbital Sciences Corporation, and its plans to market Antares as a multi-purpose, commercial launcher. Confidence always takes a hit in the wake of a failure. But Orbital has the expertise to come back - as it has done after previous launch failures.", "id": "29812139"}

{"document": "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.\nGiven such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\n\"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\nBased at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\n\"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient.

{"document": "The scale of the criminal operation has been detailed by the three sources, who say they were employed by two front-companies set up by a gang of professional fraudsters.\nThe sources describe working in \"call centres\" in two Indian cities.\nThey say as many as 60 \"employees\" work in shifts in each office, phoning TalkTalk customers and duping them into giving access to their bank accounts.\nThe whistleblowers say they were given a script in which they were told to claim they were calling from TalkTalk.\nThey say they then convinced victims to install a computer virus.\nA separate team would use that virus to gain access to victims' online banking, they add.\nWhile it has not been possible to independently verify their claims, the sources have given highly detailed accounts of the scammers' tactics, which correlate very closely with previous reports of fraud targeting TalkTalk customers.\nThe software they named also matches that identified by TalkTalk in its own website guidance on what to watch out for in a scam call.\nIn addition, a victim of the fraud shown the call centre script has confirmed it matched the one read out to her when she was conned out of \u00a35,000.\nTalkTalk was hit by a cyber-attack in October 2015, but that hack appears to be unrelated to the Indian fraud.\nInstead, it is alleged the scam is linked to problems in a company hired by the British broadband provider.\nIn 2011, TalkTalk outsourced some of its call-centre work to the Kolkata (Calcutta) office of Wipro, one of India's largest IT service companies.\nLast year, three Wipro employees were arrested on suspicion of selling TalkTalk customer data.\nA source in Kolkata, who did not want to be named, alleges the same data was obtained by a criminal gang, with USB sticks full of data trading hands at parties.\nThe criminals then used the data to operate at least three call centres, according to the whistleblowers, where staff work in shifts earning about \u00a3120 per month to perpetrate an intricate but highly successful scam.\nThey say they phone TalkTalk customers, using the stolen data to convince victims they are genuine employees of the company.\nThey then convince the victims their computers are infected, and offer to fix the problems.\nThrough this, the whistleblowers say, the victim is tricked into installing a virus that gives the scammer complete control over their machine.\nThe victims are then offered a compensation payment, for which they must log in to online banking, they add.\nThanks to the virus, the fraudsters are able to gain access to the victims' bank accounts when they log in.\nThey say they use various methods to spirit away the money: in some cases pretending to make erroneous overpayments, then convincing victims to repay the extra amount.\nIn other cases, victims have said the scammers were able to set up a new payee without their knowledge and transfer the money out of the account directly.\nAlthough the BBC cannot be sure of the whistleblowers claims, the following suggested they were telling the truth:\nDozens of customers are said to have been affected, and many have lost thousands of pounds as a result of the fraud.\nLeigh Day solicitors is representing about 20 people who have between them lost almost \u00a3100,000.\nQuestions remain about the speed with which TalkTalk responded to the data breach at Wipro, which is believed to have been in late 2014.\nIt was only in October 2015, after the apparently unrelated cyber-attack, that TalkTalk began a \"forensic review\" leading to the arrests at Wipro.\n\"We are aware that there are criminals targeting a number of UK and international companies, and we take our responsibility to protect our customers very seriously,\" said a spokeswoman for TalkTalk.\n\"This is why we launched our Beat The Scammers campaign, helping all our customers to keep themselves from safe from scammers no matter who they claim to be, while our network also proactively blocks over 90 million scam and nuisance calls a month.\"\nWipro did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhen contacted, the two companies named by the whistleblowers strongly denied any knowledge of criminal behaviour, and insisted their businesses were legitimate.\nGeoff White is a freelance investigative journalist, who has also reported for Channel 4 News", "id": "39177981"}

{"document": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"", "id": "39586912"}

{"document": "Karen Gooding\nThis is the full statement to the inquests from his sister, Karen Gooding:\nOur 'Jimmy', as he insisted on being called, was born James Robert Hennessy on 24 September, 1959 in Liverpool to parents Robert and Margaret Hennessy.\nI was 13 months old at the time and he was a welcome brother to complete the Hennessy family.\nHe was baptised at St Dominic's Roman Catholic Church and at the age of five, he joined me at the church school. We later moved to St Saviour's Roman Catholic  School in Ellesmere Port, where our dad had started a new job.\nGrowing up, Jimmy used to enjoy fishing with my dad and I with the St Saviour's freshwater fishing club, where our dad was a member.\nProfiles of all those who died\nWe would all go in a minibus with our packed lunches and fishing tackles to various canals and lakes in Cheshire, fishing for that prized catch.\nHe also loved racing homing pigeons with my dad under the proud name R Hennessy and Son, and together they won many a trophy.\nWe used to go on family holidays to Butlins with our extended family and Jimmy enjoyed going because we had cousins of a similar age to us.\nReligion played a big part in our family life. I remember we used to have to go to mass and he would tell our parents that he was going to eight o'clock mass, but go off and play with his friends. This memory still brings a smile to my face.\nJimmy had a great love for music and together we had a vast amount of LPs, some of which I still have.\nWe spent many a night in each other's bedrooms listening to music. Later on, it was trips to the infamous Eric's Club in Liverpool, which led him to follow Death School, a local Liverpool band he went to see quite often in London.\nIt was after one of these trips he arrived home wearing a 60s-style jacket with a pork pie hat in one hand and a copy of The Jam's In the City in the other, declaring that he was getting a Lambretta scooter, and he did.\nAt the age of 11, he attended Ellesmere Port Catholic High School, where he was a popular lad and indeed made quite a few close friends with whom he kept friendships throughout his life.\nHe liked school and he was a brilliant achiever academically, as reflected in his school reports. He enjoyed playing football and basketball for the school team.\nWhen he started playing basketball, it wasn't that popular in the UK. One of his teachers introduced him to it when he was about 13. He was the first recruit for the basketball team.\nI remember he nagged my mum and dad until we sent off to America for a pair of Converse he needed to play. He also used to go to Anfield to watch football with our dad.\nAfter leaving school, he attended Carlet Park College to do an engineering course, but after a year, he decided it wasn't for him.\nAt 17, he started as a plasterer's apprentice with Ellesmere Port Borough Council, where he became a plasterer. He got it into his head that he wanted to do Artex, which was the in thing at the time, so he went to London to do a course.\nAround this time, a black cloud descended on the whole family, as our dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the spine. In May, 1980, when Jimmy was 20 and I was 21, our father passed away.\nAround this time, Jimmy was introduced to a girl whom he married in December 1981. The marriage lasted only a few years, after which he returned home with his faithful companion, a dog named Spike.\nI remember him saying that the one good thing to come out of the marriage was the arrival of his daughter, Charlotte, whom he loved dearly.\nAs time went by, he had two little nephews, Graeme and Iain, to whom he was godfather and whom he found highly amusing.\nIn the coming years, Liverpool Football Club played a big part in our Jimmy's life. He watched them at home and away and overseas. He was a proper Liverpool supporter.\nHe went to Rome, Paris and Germany to see his club play. He used to do at least one football-related activity once a week. He also enjoyed being captain of the local pool team, but it was not something he showed off.\nHe was a very private person. In the pub, he would sit silently on a ledge between the pool table area and the bar until it was his time to play.\nHe was very unassuming. That said, he was very much into his fashion and having unusual stuff. He always had to be different from everybody else and be the first to get the latest thing.\nHe loved to run. He ran about five to six miles every day without fail. He was addicted to it.\nJimmy had everything to look forward to. He had started a new relationship and just launched his own plastering business around the time he died.\nThe business venture proved to be successful, thus enabling him to take on two young lads as labourers. He had a lot going for him and I was proud of him.\nAs the saying goes, he was tall, dark and handsome. He had lovely grey eyes and, though he wasn't one for smiling, he had a lovely smile when he chose to share it.\nIt is a smile I still see in my daughter, Victoria, today.\nJimmy was a man of very few words with a witty and dry sense of humour. He loved to laugh and banter with his family and friends from Sutton Way.\nJimmy had ambitions. He loved his life. He was always there when we needed him. I remember that after my dad died and I got married, it was just him and my mum in the house, and we were a very close-knit family.\nJimmy was very close to our mum. To her, he was especially precious, having already lost her first son, Stephen, when he was a baby.\nHer love for him is endless and, 25 years on, she still grieves for him with a broken heart that will never mend, all because he went to watch a game of football.\nAs mentioned above, he was a quiet and extremely private person. I would like to think that he wouldn't mind me writing all this about him.\nI would hope he understands that I had to talk about him because, you see, he was not body number seven to me. He was 'our Jimmy', her son, my brother.\nThis is the full statement to the inquests from his daughter, Charlotte Hennessy:\nJimmy Hennessy is my dad. I only had six little years with him, but they were some of the best years of my life.\nAs I was so young when he died, my mum and aunts have helped me to prepare this statement.\nMy dad was a beautiful person. He was quiet and kept himself to himself. No-one had a bad word to say about him, nor he them.\nHe had lots of friends and was liked by all who knew him.\nHe was a good looking man. He loved clothes and always had the best of the best and was so vain.\nHe is well remembered in our house for fixing his hair in the mirror every time he left. My dad was a mod with all the attire, including a green Lambretta.\nHe had a great sense of humour - very dry and very funny. The word gargoyle used to make him laugh and he thought sloths were hilarious.\nHe was always up for a laugh, even at the expense of my aunty and her stripy socks.\nMy mum and dad met through friends in 1979 and started seeing each other in February, 1980.\nMy dad's favourite band was The Jam and, together with friends, my mum and dad would go and see them in Deeside and Liverpool.\nOn 11 December, 1981, my parents married at Chester Registry Office followed by a meal at The Witches' Kitchen.\nIn May 1982, they got their first house. My dad was deeply loved by my maternal family. My nan and aunties loved him to bits.\nWe were all very close and have treasured memories of him.\nMy Aunty Jacquie was just 14 when my mum and dad started dating and she remembers my dad's fantastic taste in clothes and being jealous of his lovely things.\nShe permed his hair once. This is a favourite memory of my Aunty Jo because, when my dad returned from his perming session, the curls were too tight and my dad was having a breakdown.\nTrying to be helpful, my Aunty Jo suggested he blow dry it. Needless to say, he was then modelling a big Afro frizz. He vowed never to ask Aunty Jo for advice again.\nOn Wednesday, June 9, I was born weighing a massive 8 lbs 14 ozs. Goody Two Shoes by Adam Ant was number one in the charts and Jimmy Hennessy, the mod, became a daddy. He named me Charlotte.\nHis passion was LFC. He went to games in the UK and abroad. Bill Shankly was his hero as well as, of course, our King Kenny and Ian Rush.\nMy dad referred to me as \"Red, White and Gold\", which was the colours of our kit at the time. He was over the moon when I was born and I think it's fair to say that little Charlotte Hennessy and LFC equalised.\nMy dad loved going out with his friends, Charlie Tigs and Steve. They were in a band and he would go and watch them at the Bull's Head with my mum too.\nHis favourite book was Kes, was my favourite book in school too. His favourite film was 'Quadrophenia'.\nI know a different side to Jimmy Hennessy. I know him as daddy, the man who I adored. He threw himself into parenthood - he would change my nappies, did his share of feeds and he loved taking me out in my pram.\nHe worked hard to provide for me as a self-employed plasterer and, to this day, the smell of plaster reminds me of my dad.\nWhat my dad's mates don't know is that he would let me play with his hair and put bobbles in! I would paint his nails. We would play in my Wendy House and we were always at the park.\nI was a daddy's girl, and I still to this day have the pram he bought me.\nMy mum and dad divorced in 1985 but it never affected our relationship. I remember my dad being a part of our lives every day.\nI used to think he had magical powers because I would sit behind my Nanny Hennessy's sofa and pick my nose and every time he would say, 'Stop picking your nose!', and I never understood how he knew.\nTwo weeks before my dad died, my mum and aunty went out as my Aunty Jo was moving to Jersey. My dad was looking after me. When I was in bed, I was messing  around with a green wooden beaded necklace which got tangled in my hair.\nI was worried about being told off and I crept downstairs, knocked on the living room door and in my little Scouse accent said, 'Dad, I've got me beads stuck in me hair'.\nIt was no problem, though. My dad sat and patiently untangled the necklace, brushed my hair and carried me back to bed!\nThat's one of my last memories of him. There are no words to describe how much I miss him. My heart broke the day my dad died and losing him broke the heart of my family too.\nWhenever I was hurt and needed a hug, my dad was there with a hug, but when my dad was hurt and needed a hug, I couldn't give him one.\nTo date, we have lost out on 9,145 days and not one goes by when I don't think about him. We have lost out on 25 Christmases, 25 of my birthdays and 25 of his. - that's a lot of hugs.\nToday, my dad is also a grandad to my three beautiful little boys, Liam-James, Joseph and Jacob. My boys and my mum are what keep me functioning.\nAt times when Hillsborough consumes me and makes my heart ache, they make me realise life is worth living and that my dad lives on through us. I always tell my boys about their granddad.\nThey call him 'Special Grandad, the brightest star in the sky' and enjoy being the first to spot him.\nPeople are quick to tell me, 'You were too little, you didn't really know your dad', but I do remember and I did know him.\nIt is like a part of me is missing. I am incomplete. We had so much to do together, so many more memories to make and Hillsborough took that away from us.\nHillsborough took my dad away from me like he was nothing and nobody, but he was everything to me.\nLosing my dad at Hillsborough stole my childhood from me and took away my best friend. It left me in a life of anger and bitterness and depression. I don't want to live in the shadow of Hillsborough any more and when all this is over, may my dad rest in peace.\nMy dad will always be my hero, and I will always be a daddy's girl. No-one can take that away from me.", "id": "27219111"}

{"document": "She inveighed against a \"draconian policy of austerity\" that favoured \"globalised elites at the expense of the people\".\nThe speaker was not a left-wing firebrand, but the leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen.\nThe Front first emerged in the 1980s as a mainly anti-immigration group. Ms Le Pen is careful not to neglect this core issue, but nowadays she frames her nationalist message in anti-globalisation terms.\nUnder both the right and the left, she contends, France has surrendered its sovereign powers to EU bureaucrats who are setting interest rates and tearing down borders for the sole benefit of big business.\n\"The grave diggers of Brussels,\" as Ms Le Pen put it, \"are setting France on the path to under-development\".\nShe found a receptive audience among the struggling workers who had come from all over France to hear her speak.\nRoger Denis, a 41-year-old haulier from the eastern city of Nancy, feels his job is threatened.  \"My company uses a lot of Polish drivers,\" he says.  \"I have nothing against them, but they are working for 800 euros a month (\u00c2\u00a3650; $1,100).  They have Polish number plates, but of course they work in France.\"\nPatrick Cathala is in an even more precarious position. Five years ago he lost his construction job, and he too regards himself as a victim of Europe's open-border policies.\n\"I'm unemployed because firms prefer to hire workers from Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal or Spain. They're letting all those people in.  What am I supposed to do?\"\nThe transformation of the Front from fringe group into France's leading working-class party is not sudden. In the 1980s Jean-Marie Le Pen - the founder of the FN and the current leader's father - targeted urban voters who were leaving the Communist Party in droves.\nIt was he who decided to hold the Front's annual march on 1 May - the traditional Labour Day celebrated by trade unions. It is now by far the biggest event in Paris on that date.\nUnder Marine Le Pen, the drive to capture far-left votes has been extended to moderate socialists, says Guillaume Bernard from the Catholic Institute of Higher Studies.\nHow FN won in socialist heartland\n\"Those voters are typically public workers and pensioners and these people are sensitive to a message emphasising the role of the state,\" says Mr Bernard.\nThis has meant not just a shift in emphasis in the FN's message - unfettered markets have all but replaced uncontrolled immigration as its main bugbear - but also a new geographical focus.\nStudies have highlighted a growing divide in France between city dwellers and those living in the countryside. The first tend to do well, and benefit from globalisation; the second group feel left out.\nLast year Marine Le Pen went on a \"tour of forgotten France\" (\"Tour de France des Oublies\"), taking her message to rural areas and small towns that suffer social deprivation and poor public services.\nShe told residents she felt their pain - while Paris and Brussels officials had sacrificed \"small people\" to multinationals who wanted an impoverished workforce. Her efforts paid off in recent local elections, when the Front made huge gains.\nIts most notable success was in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, a former socialist stronghold which the FN captured in the first round.\nOlivier, 43, speaks for many residents when he says he is \"open\" to the Front's message. After working for 21 years as a maintenance technician, he is no better off than many living on benefits or the minimum wage. \"I am sliding towards the bottom,\" he says.\nMillions feel the same way up and down the country. Some opinion polls suggest the Front may win a quarter of the votes in this month's European elections.\nAnd its appeal may rise even further.  According to one study, as much as 60% of the population belong to \"peripheral France\". Not all will support the FN but it still represents a large pool of potential gains, especially if France's economy deteriorates further.\nThe shifting focus of the Front raises two questions - one related to domestic politics and the other of EU-wide significance.\nFirst, can a mass party like the FN still be described as \"extreme-right\", as it is by French commentators, or even \"far-right\"?\nThe party is \"extreme\" in the relative sense that there is no significant force further to the right, but its main message is not extremist per se, analyst Bernard Guillaume notes.\nThe idea that workers need to be protected from foreign competitors - \"national preference\" in modern FN parlance - was accepted by all French parties until World War Two. Even recently, France has argued that trade liberalisation in farming or cultural products would be a disaster.\nThe Front's core contention - that the free flow of goods and people is just as dangerous within Europe as it is globally - is controversial. But it has consistency on its side if you take a dim view of free trade - which is the standard view in France.\nThe party's stance may nowadays be better characterised as \"populist\" or \"nationalist\", rather that \"extreme\".\nThe second question regards links the FN wants to forge with like-minded groups across Europe - such as Britain's UKIP, the FPO in Austria, Geert Wilders' party in the Netherlands, and others in central and eastern Europe.\nMany of these parties do not share the Front's hostility to \"neo-liberalism\". Can they form a cohesive force in the EU parliament?\nLudovic de Danne, a Euro-MP who speaks on international affairs for the FN, thinks so.  Eurosceptic parties, he insists, will ignore their differences to focus on the one issue that unites them: \"We are forming an alliance on European questions.\"\nBe that as it may, the main populist offensive against the EU will probably take place not in the European Parliament but at national level.\nUKIP, for instance, has high hopes for a planned referendum on Britain's membership. In France, the FN will continue to tap the nation's atavistic attachment to the state and mistrust of markets.", "id": "27404016"}

{"document": "It should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change... to strengthen governance,\" he said.\nHe added that shareholders also had to take responsibility and act if a company's standards were failing.\nThe FRC said it had requested more powers to tackle bad behaviour.\nFrom the end of MG Rover, to the near-collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, through to Tesco's accounting scandal and BHS's extinction, failings in corporate leadership have continued to stalk UK businesses.\nIt is 25 years since the Cadbury code was published, which put in place most of the rules governing public company practices and is overseen by the FRC.\nSir Adrian Cadbury wrote his report in 1992 following scandals such as the collapse of the bank BCCI and textile company Polly Peck, along with Robert Maxwell's raid on Mirror Group pensioners. It has been the cornerstone of corporate governance ever since.\nIt recommended an independent board, reasonable pay to attract executives and formal processes to appoint directors.\n\"The Financial Reporting Council which controls the Cadbury code, and is a rather timid body, should get stronger,\" Lord Myners told the BBC's Today programme.\nIt should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change in a number of areas to strengthen governance\".\nThe code has no punitive means of enforcement and follows a so-called comply or explain model. If a company wishes to shun a particular rule, it can give its reasons for doing so.\nThis arrangement aims to stop companies ducking rules as a matter course and rewards openness. But critics say it treats all rules as optional.\n\"It hasn't been binding enough,\" Lord Myners said.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the FRC said: \"The FRC has called on the government for more powers to tackle all directors when companies fail, not just those we regulate (accountants and actuaries), and we want more scrutiny on directors fulfilling their obligations under the Companies Act.\n\"The Corporate Governance Code's 'comply or explain' approach has allowed the FRC to respond confidently and effectively to evolving market circumstances, which prescriptive hard rules often cannot.\"\nIts latest monitoring report on the code shows \"high compliance\" among companies, but when boards don't follow the rules \"too many explanations are of poor quality\".\n\"This suggests that some boards still need to do more than pay lip service to the needs of their shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\"The FRC believes more focused reporting by boards on how they discharge their responsibilities is necessary and has called for more oversight powers from government to help achieve this.\"\nAnother criticism from Lord Myners is the role of shareholders themselves in controlling corporations.\n\"Cadbury did not focus at all on the roles and the duties and obligation of the shareholders and that's where the failing is happening,\" he said.\n\"Nobody owns enough of a company to really be put out enough to really dig in and find out what's wrong.\" He termed this the problem of \"ownerless corporations.\"\nThis view echoed that of Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, who told the Today programme in September that UK companies should adopt a Swedish-style shareholder committee in an effort to curb excessive pay for bosses.\nThe five biggest shareholders in large publicly-traded companies would sit on the committee, Mr Philp suggested, and this would make decisions on pay and hiring directors.\nHis plan follows a call from Prime Minister Theresa May for tighter controls on corporate excess.", "id": "39139300"}
