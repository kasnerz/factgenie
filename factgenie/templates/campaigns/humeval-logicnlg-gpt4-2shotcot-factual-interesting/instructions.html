    <!-- TODO (oplatek) {{ annotation_example_cnt }} does not work In this task, you will annotate <b>{{ annotation_example_cnt }} examples</b> in total. -->
    In this task, you will annotate claims about a table. In each example you will see the table title, the table and a short claim itself.
    For each example, you will see <b>data</b> on the left side and the corresponding generated <b>textual claim</b> on the right side.
    Your task is to <b>annotate</b> in the text with respect to the data.
</p>

<p>
    There are four types of annotations that you can mark in the generated text:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><span style="background-color: #ffbcbc"><b>Incorrect fact</b></span>: 
        The fact in the text contradicts the data.
    </li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #e9d2ff"><b>Uncheckable</b></span> :
        The fact in the text cannot be checked given the data in the table. It may be true, but it is not commonly known all over the world by most of the people.
    </li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #27e6a6"><b>Interesting</b></span>:
        The fact in the text is interesting for the expected audience.
    </li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #c9c0cc"><b>Obvious</b></span> :
        The fact is boring, considered common knowledge, irrelevant, or repetitive. The opposite of interesting.
    </li>
</ol>

                Annotate the text by dragging your mouse over the text, highlighting the text span.
                Once you annotated or reviewed the text for all the categories, click the <b> âœ… Mark example as complete</b> button.
                You can still update the annotation later.
                You will be able to submit the annotations once they are all are marked as complete.
                </p>

                <p>
                To switch between error categories, repeatedly click on the highlighted text (the last click removes the highlight).
                Note that highlighting from the right to left can work better for longer spans.
